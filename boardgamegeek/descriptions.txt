Two players take on the role of Master Spies as they attempt to use their country's resources to sway the people of six countries into joining their faction.<br/><br/>The two players draw from a communal deck to build their hands in an attempt to create card combinations that will allow the shifting of allegiance in six different countries.  Every card may be used offensively, defensively or for a special effect.  Careful planning and maneuvering of their master spy pawn results in increased effectiveness of the cards or the ability to trigger an offensive action that catches the opponent off guard.<br/><br/>A game takes between 15 and 30 minutes for experienced players and between 30 and 45 minutes for inexperienced players.  The game is marketed for ages 14 and up.<br/><br/>1955: The War of Espionage is to be released at GenCon 2011 by APE Games and Living Worlds Games.<br/><br/> 
From the author:<br/><br/>&quot;Sometimes the history of a nation can be defined by the relationship between two individuals. The Election of 1960 is the story of two men, John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon. One is the scion of a wealthy, politically powerful family from New England. The other is the son of a Quaker grocer in Whittier, California. While they belong to opposing political parties, they start out as friends. The complex development of that friendship, however, would shape a pivotal presidential election and cast a long shadow over American history for the remainder of the 20th century.<br/><br/>&quot;In 1960: The Making of the President, you take on the role of one of these great protagonists vying for the right to lead his country into the heart of the Cold War. However, it is not just foreign policy that poses a challenge to American leadership; this is also an era of great social turmoil and progress. As the United States continues to build upon the promise of its founding, candidates must contend with the question of civil rights and balance their positions on social justice against the need for valuable Southern electoral votes. Of course, the ever-present issue of the economy also rears its ugly head, and both Nixon and Kennedy will compete to be the candidate with the voters' pocket books in mind.<br/><br/>&quot;The contest is fought out on an electoral map of the United States as it stood in 1960&mdash;a map where Louisiana and Florida share the same number of electoral votes, as do California and Pennsylvania. Using a card-driven game system, all the major events which shaped the campaign are represented: Nixon&rsquo;s lazy shave, President Eisenhower&rsquo;s late endorsement, and the 'Catholic question' are all included as specific event cards. The famous televised debates and final election day push are each handled with their own subsystems. Candidates vie to capture each state&rsquo;s electoral votes using campaign points in the four different regions of the country. At the same time, they must build momentum by dominating the issues of the day and attempt to gain control of the airwaves.<br/><br/>&quot;As with any election campaign, the challenge is to adapt your game plan as the ground shifts out from under you. There are never enough resources or time to do everything, but you need to make the tough calls to propel yourself into the White House. This fast-playing strategy game for two players challenges you to run for the most powerful elective office in the world, at one of its most unique crossroads. Will you recreate history, or rewrite it? 1960: The Making of the President provides you the opportunity to do both.&quot;<br/><br/> 
Description from BoardgameNews.com:<br/><br/>7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player, as in Fairy Tale or a Magic: the Gathering booster draft. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided as in Bauza's Ghost Stories.) Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.<br/><br/>In essence 7 Wonders is a card development game along the lines of Race for the Galaxy or Dominion. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points. Unlike Magic or Fairy Tale, however, each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you'll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how his choices might affect what you've already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions.<br/><br/>Though the box is listed as being for 3-7 players, there is an official 2-player variant included in the instructions.<br/><br/> 
7 Wonders: Leaders adds 42 new cards to the base game of 7 Wonders, comprising four new guilds, one new wonder card, and 36 (+1 blank) white &quot;Leader&quot; cards. At the start of the game, each player takes a hand of four leaders and may play one at the start of each of the three Ages. Unlike the standard cards, leaders cost money (not resources). The expansion comes with a new Wonder - the ancient city of Rome - and contains 6-gold tokens made of cardboard for more efficient money-management.<br/><br/> 
In one of his sillier games, Karl-Heinz Schmiel casts the players as semi-psychotic cooks attempting to hone their culinary skills. Each player receives a miniature pan and a hotplate. Then each turn you can either attempt to turn up the heat, season your dish, or attempt to steal another cook's recipe in the making. Heating your hotplate is a random affair with a die, and could raise the heat on everyone's plate. Spicing the dish is heart of the game and done by up-ending small bottles filled with little colored wood pellets. When the pellets tumble out of the bottle (sometimes, if they do), the number of pellets can't exceed two, because over-spicing the dish ruins it and you have to throw it in the trash!<br/><br/>The 2009 version includes some changed rules, a new victory condition, additional recipes and some new mechanics in comparison to the 1989 version.<br/><br/> 
The S.S. Nvrsnks is going down, and who is always first off a sinking ship? The rats!<br/><br/>Abandon Ship is a game in which you play to move your group of rats off the ship before the rising water drowns them. The Nvrsnks is also loaded with valuable points-earning cheese, but don&rsquo;t let desire for that lovely food send your rats to the watery depths. Your opponents may also share some of the rats in your group; they may want to move the rats in a different manner from you. Will their plan send yours into the drink?<br/><br/> 
This Sid Sackson classic has taken many different forms over the years depending on the publisher.  Each player strategically invests in businesses, trying to retain a majority of stock.  As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains.  All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer, larger business.  The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth.<br/><br/>Some versions of the 3M bookshelf edition included rules for a 2-player variant.<br/><br/>The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.<br/><br/> 
In Agricola, you're a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood, or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?<br/><br/>The game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the use (or non-use) of two of its main types of cards, Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release), these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist.<br/><br/>Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game turns plus 6 harvest phases (after turn 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).<br/>Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and wife) and thus can take two actions per turn. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a turn, a new action card is flipped over.<br/>Problem: Each action can be taken just once per turn, so it's important to do some things with high preference.<br/>Each player also starts with a hand of 7 job cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 item cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. Speaking of which, there are countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, and sometimes it is better to react to your opponents' actions.<br/><br/>Description taken from BoardgameNews.com.<br/><br/> 
From Lookout Games:<br/><br/>This is not a complete game. You need AGRICOLA to play this expansion set.<br/><br/>Over the past years, many small expansions for Agricola were released, mostly in German language. Lookout Games, the publisher, also introduced deluxe wooden pieces to complement the game. The Goodies Expansion contains:<br/><br/><br/>     Agricola X-Deck -- 24 cards with alien encounters all over the farm. Every time a player visits a stone quarry, a card is drawn from the pile. And then? Resistance is futile!<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Agricola Ö-Deck -- 12 new Occupations and 12 new Minor Improvements including a wunderkind, the guy with the couch, the singing family from the Alps, and of course that one specific Governor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Agricola CZ-Deck -- 12 Occupations and 12 Improvements.  Based on famous people, places, and historic events from the Czech Republic. Illustrated in the spirit of the artist Josef Lada, this expansion was initiated by the Czech Publisher of Agricola-Mindok.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Agricola L-Deck -- Nobody knows exactly what the L stands for. Some tend to believe Lookout, others insist on Looneys. Decide for yourself; but don't take it too serious.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     5 double-sided theme boards -- Western, Spring, Autumn, Winter, and Mars.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Sticker Sheet (70 stickers) -- 35 adults, 33 children, 1 alien, and 1 werewolf.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Wooden Meeples -- Veggiemeeples, Animeeples, and Resourceeples.<br/><br/><br/>Since these items have been generally available in Germany, Agricola: The Goodies will be released only in English and Spanish.<br/><br/>Microbadges:<br/><br/> - Agricola: I use all the goodies!<br/><br/> 
Before Ticket to Ride, before Santa Fe Rails, before Union Pacific &ndash; yet after Acquire &ndash; there was Airlines, one of the earliest published games from designer Alan R. Moon and publisher ABACUSSPIELE.<br/><br/>More than two decades after the publication of that game, Moon and ABACUSSPIELE present Airlines Europe, the design of which Moon began in 2007. According to the publisher, &quot;He wanted to preserve the feel of the original game and its successor, Union Pacific, while confronting the player with even more exciting choices.&quot; The result of that redesign process is Airlines Europe, featuring a reduced playing time, a new point structure, a European setting, and 112 tiny detailed airplanes.<br/><br/>At its heart, Airlines Europe is a stock game, with players earning points for the stock they hold in particular airline companies when one of the randomly determined scorings takes place. On a player's turn, that player either expands an airline and claims a stock, plays stock onto the board and receives dividend, invests in a special airline called Air ABACUS or gets a certain amount of money from the bank. A player scores only for stock in play, but the value of an airline is determined by the value of the route licences that airline owns  &ndash; thus, you're torn in terms of what to play when.<br/><br/>Some changes compared to Airlines:<br/><br/><br/>     map of Europe<br/>     no flight cards <br/>     special Air ABACUS airline similar to the Union Pacific <br/>     share track system<br/>     separate victory point and money systems<br/>     airplane miniatures<br/>     no sabotage <br/>     up to 5 players<br/>     reduced playtime<br/><br/><br/>Some changes compared to Union Pacific:<br/><br/><br/>     airplane theme<br/>     map of Europe<br/>     no track cards<br/>     Air ABACUS is acquired by trading in other shares<br/>     share track system <br/>     separate victory point and money systems<br/>     up to 5 players<br/>     reduced playtime <br/><br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Airlines<br/>    Union Pacific<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 
The animals want to show how good they are at making tall pyramids!  They must be skillfully careful: Who will position the penguin on top of the crocodile, the sheep on top of the penguin, the serpent on the sheep?  The hedgehog wants to stand on top of the pyramid but the height is making him dizzy.<br/><br/>Tier auf Tier (a.k.a. Animal Upon Animal, Pyramide d'animaux, and Dier op dier) is a simple stacking game, listed for ages 4-99, with 29 cute wooden animals.<br/><br/> 
From the publisher:<br/><br/>Anomia: [uh-NO-mee-uh] - Noun - 1) A problem with word finding or recall. 2) Chaos. 3) The game where common knowledge becomes uncommonly fun!<br/><br/>Anomia plays off the fact that our minds are positively brimming with all sorts of random information; things to eat, pop songs, websites, etc... Sure, under normal circumstances, it's easy enough to give an example of a frozen food, or a dog breed; but you will find that your brain works a little differently under pressure!<br/><br/>The directions are simple. Draw a card from the center pile and flip it over. Does the symbol on your card match one on another player's card? If so, you must quickly face-off with the other player by giving an example of the person, place, or thing on their card before they can do the same for yours. If you blurt a correct answer out first, you win their card and drawing continues. Sounds simple, right? Wrong!<br/><br/>Wild cards allow unlike symbols to match, increasing the number of things you must pay attention to. Cascading face-offs can occur when you hand over a lost card revealing a new top card on your play pile. All this adds up to a high-energy, hilarious play experience where everyone is involved at all times.<br/><br/>Easy to learn, fun to play over and over again, Anomia will have any group of friends, family, even perfect strangers, shouting and laughing out loud as they try to beat each other to the punch!<br/><br/> 
Apples to Apples consists only of two decks of cards: Things and Descriptions.  Each turn, the current referee selects a Description and players try to pick, from the cards in their hands, the Things that best match that Description.  The referee then chooses the Thing that appeals most and awards the card to the player who played it.  The unusual combinations of Things and Descriptions are humorous to the extreme, and will quickly have the entire room in an uproar.  Once a player has won a pre-determined number of cards, that player wins.<br/><br/>The original Apples to Apples Core Set was the first entry in the Apples to Apples Series.  The Apples to Apples Core Set had four card expansions: Apples to Apples - Expansion Set #1, Apples to Apples - Expansion Set #2, Apples to Apples - Expansion Set #3 and Apples to Apples - Expansion Set #4, that provided more Things and Descriptions to choose from.<br/><br/>In 2003 Apples to Apples Party Box Edition was released and included the Apples to Apples Core Set of cards as well as the cards from Apples to Apples - Expansion Set #1 and Apples to Apples - Expansion Set #2.  It comes in the standard box, or packaged in a Crate Edition with a wooden box.<br/><br/>The Apples to Apples Party Box Edition had a card expansion Apples to Apples Party Box Expansion ONE that included the cards from Apples to Apples - Expansion Set #3 and Apples to Apples - Expansion Set #4, and an expansion of completely new cards in Apples to Apples Party Box Expansion TWO<br/><br/>Re-implemented as:<br/><br/><br/>     Apples to Apples Kids<br/>     Apples to Apples Junior<br/>     Apples to Apples: British Isles Edition<br/>     Apples to Apples: Bible Edition<br/>     Apples to Apples: Jewish Edition<br/>     Apples to Apples: Yiddish Edition<br/>     Apples to Apples to Go<br/><br/><br/> 
Are You the Traitor? is a secret role selection game akin to Werewolf/Mafia.  One player is the Evil Wizard, attempting to obtain the Magic Key for nefarious purposes.  Another player is the Good Wizard, trying to destroy the Key to keep it out of Evil hands.  The other players support Good or Evil in various roles.<br/><br/>Each round, there is a discussion period, after which one of the players acts.  After someone acts, the players determine whether the forces of Good or Evil were served, with the prevailing side gaining treasure.  Play continues until one player gets enough treasure to win.<br/><br/> 
<br/>        The year is 1926, and it is the height of the Roaring Twenties. Flappers dance till dawn in smoke-filled speakeasies drinking alcohol supplied by rum runners and the mob. It's a celebration to end all celebrations in the aftermath of the war to end all wars.<br/><br/><br/><br/>        Yet a dark shadow grows in the city of Arkham.

These gates have begun to open and must be closed before the Ancient Ones make our world their ruined domination.<br/><br/><br/><br/>        Only a handful of investigators stand against the Arkham Horror.  Will they Prevail? <br/><br/><br/>Arkham Horror is a cooperative adventure game themed around H.P Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. Players choose from 16 Investigators and take to the streets of Arkham. Before the game, one of the eight Ancient Ones is chosen and it's up to the Investigators to prevent it from breaking into our world. During the course of the game, players will upgrade their characters by acquiring skills, allies, items, weapons, and spells. It's up to the players to clean out the streets of Arkham by fighting many different types of monsters, but their main goal is to close portals to other dimensions that are opening up around town. With too many portals open the Ancient One awakens and the players only have one last chance to save the world. Defeat the Ancient One in combat!<br/><br/> 
Description from BoardgameNews.com:<br/><br/>Army of Frogs is for 2-4 players and resembles Hive in that the gameboard is created while you play. The goal of the game is to create one large group of frogs&mdash;an army, if you will&mdash;through tactical manoeuvring and placement of the pieces, which are hexagonal Bakelite frogs. Each player starts with two randomly drawn frogs, and on a turn a player takes the following three actions to build and shift an island of frogs in the center of the table:<br/><br/>     if possible, move a frog of his color that&rsquo;s on the board to a new location (something that&rsquo;s obviously skipped on the first turn)<br/>     add one of the frogs in his supply to the board, and<br/>     draw a new frog from the bag and add it to his supply.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The first player to link all their frogs (with at least seven in play) wins the game.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href="http://www.armyoffrogs.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.armyoffrogs.com/</a><br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     Boardspace.net (real-time, AI option)<br/><br/><br/>

Ascension is a fast paced deckbuilding game designed by Magic Pro Tour champions Justin Gary, Rob Dougherty, and Brian Kibler, with artwork by Eric Sabee. Ascension is a deck-building game where players spend Runes to acquire more powerful cards for their deck. It offers a dynamic play experience where players have to react and adjust their strategy accordingly.<br/><br/>Gameplay is similar to other deckbuilding games, with the player adding cards to their deck by purchasing them from a central deck, which has the top six cards revealed and available for purchase. When cards are removed, they are replaced with a new one from the top of the deck.  Victory points are earned in three ways: firstly, each card purchased is worth one or more victory points; second, victory points can be gained by defeating monsters with a power resource featured on several of the cards; finally, some cards give victory points directly each time they are played.<br/><br/>Integrates with:<br/><br/>    Ascension: Return of the Fallen<br/>    Ascension: Storm of Souls<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 
At the Gates of Loyang is a trading game in which you are able to produce goods by planting them and later selling them to customers. You can use the abilities of some helpers to increase your income or production.<br/><br/>Fields, customers, helpers, and miscellaneous objects are represented by cards. Each player receives two of these cards per round distributed by a bidding/drawing mechanism in which you end up with one of the cards you draw and one of the cards of a public offer filled by all players. Additionally, to these cards you always receive one field for free each round.<br/><br/>Placing one good on a field fills the complete field with goods of this type. Each round, one unit per field is harvested. After planting, harvesting, and distributing cards, each player can use as many actions as he wants, only limited by the number of his cards or the number of goods he owns. At the end of his turn, he can invest the earned money on a scoring track, where early money is worth more than late money. The game ends after a certain number of rounds, and the player who is first on the scoring track wins.<br/><br/>

A clever repackaging of the parlor game Dictionary, Balderdash contains several cards with real words nobody has heard of.  After one of those words has been read aloud, players try to come up with definitions that at least sound plausible, because points are later awarded for every opposing player who guessed that your definition was the correct one.<br/><br/>Versions of the game as a parlor game go back at least as far as 1970, although Balderdash itself was not published until 1984.<br/><br/>Mattel republished Balderdash in 2006 in a form that derives its gameplay from the sequel Beyond Balderdash.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Beyond Balderdash / Absolute Balderdash<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Beyond Balderdash*<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>*In a peculiar situation, this game was reimplemented by Beyond/Absolute Balderdash and then combined back into the original title (Balderdash) but with the rules and cards from Beyond/Absolute.<br/><br/> 
A Scrabble-like game without the board -- much like Pick Two!, but without the letter values.<br/><br/>Using a selection of 144 plastic letter tiles in the English edition, each player works independently to create their own 'crossword'. When a player uses up all their letters, all players take a new tile from the pool. When all the tiles are gone, the first player to use up all the tiles in their hand wins.<br/><br/>There are also variants included in the rules, and the game is suitable for solo play.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Double Bananagrams<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

&quot;The Outlaws hunt the Sheriff. The Sheriff hunts the Outlaws. The Renegade plots secretly, ready to take one side or the other. Bullets fly. Who among the gunmen is a Deputy, ready to sacrifice himself for the Sheriff? And who is a merciless Outlaw, willing to kill him? If you want to find out, just draw (your cards)!&quot; (From back of box)<br/><br/>This card game recreates an old-fashioned spaghetti western shoot-out, with each player randomly receiving a Character card to determine special abilities, and a secret Role card to determine their goal.<br/><br/>Four different Roles are available, each with a unique victory condition:<br/><br/>     Sheriff - Kill all Outlaws and the Renegade<br/>     Deputy - Protect the Sheriff and kill any Outlaws<br/>     Outlaw - Kill the Sheriff<br/>     Renegade - Be the last person standing<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>A player's Role is kept secret, except for the Sheriff. Character cards are placed face-up on table, and also track strength (hand limit) in addition to special ability.<br/><br/>There are 22 different types of cards in the draw deck. Most common are the BANG! cards, which let you shoot at another player, assuming the target is within &quot;range&quot; of your current gun.  The target player can play a &quot;MISSED!&quot; card to dodge the shot.  Other cards can provide temporary boosts while in play (for example, different guns to improve your firing range) and special one-time effects to help you or hinder your opponents (such as Beer to restore health, or Barrels to hide behind during a shootout). A horse is useful for keeping your distance from unruly neighbors, while the Winchester can hit a target at range 5. The Gatling is a deadly exception where range doesn't matter - it can only be used once, but targets all other players at the table!<br/><br/>Information on the cards is displayed using language-independent symbols, and 7 summary/reference cards are included.<br/><br/>Re-Released:<br/><br/>     Bang!

No laws in the whole Wild West can stop them!

Battle rages on between orcs and knights. Purple and Orange form a chaotic melee and no-one knows which side will win this battle. Mage towers scattered on the battlefield are strategic objectives, and it soon appears that whomever controls the most towers will reap the seeds of victory.<br/><br/>Players place tiles to form majorities of their army on the corners of towers: when all 4 corners are resolved, the player with the majority of corners seizes control of the tower.<br/><br/>Special power tokens can increase your presence or decrease your opponent's presence as well as doing a few other things.<br/><br/>There are 5 special tiles included in the game for added strategies.<br/><br/>Debuted here in Fangs and Swords - 2 players tile game of orcs vs knight combat (V.2-updated).<br/><br/> 
Two opponents face off across a 'battle line' and attempt to win the battle by taking 5 of 9 flags or 3 adjacent flags. Flags are decided by placing cards into 3 card poker-type hands on either side of the flag (similar to straight flush, 3 of a kind, straight, flush, etc). The side with the highest 'formation' of cards wins the flag.<br/><br/>This is a rethemed version of Schotten-Totten with different graphics and wooden flag bits in place of the boundary stone cards.  Game play is identical, except the cards run from 1 to 10 (not 9), you hold seven cards in your hand (not 6), and the rule that stones may only be claimed at the start of your turn is presented as an &quot;advanced variant&quot;.<br/><br/>Some have reported that the production quality of the cards is inferior to the Schotten-Totten cards, however, for most readers Battle Line will be much easier to find in stores.

Battleship was originally a pencil-and-paper public domain game known by different names, but Milton Bradley made it into the well known board game in 1967.  The pencil and paper grids were changed to plastic grids with holes that could hold plastic pegs used to record the guesses.<br/><br/>Each player deploys his ships (of lengths varying from 2 to 5 squares) secretly on a square grid.  Then each player shoots at the other's grid by calling a location.  The defender responds by &quot;Hit!&quot; or &quot;Miss!&quot;.  You try to deduce where the enemy ships are and sink them.  First to do so wins.<br/><br/>The Salvo variant listed in the rules allows each player to call out from 1 to 5 shots at a time depending on the amount of ships the player has left (IE: players each start off with 5 ships, so they start off with 5 shots.  As ships are sunk, the players gets fewer shots).  This version of the game is closer to the original pencil-and-paper public domain game.  Many versions of the pencil-and-paper game have different amounts of shots based on the ship (IE: Battleship: 5 shots. Destroyer: 3 Shots, Etc.).<br/><br/>In 2008, Hasbro &quot;reinvented&quot; the game into Battleship (Revised), which is the current version of the game sold.<br/><br/>Some history of the published versions of the game:<br/><br/>1931: Starex Novelty Co. of NY publishes Salvo.<br/><br/>1933: The Strathmore Co. publishes Combat, The Battleship Game.<br/><br/>1943: Milton Bradley publishes the pad-and-pencil game Broadsides, The Game of Naval Strategy.<br/><br/>1943: Also published in 1943 Sink it by the L R Gebert Co. for distribution by G.

(info from the designer's website)<br/><br/>THE GAME CONCEPT<br/>You are an abbot of a medieval monastery competing with other abbots to amass the greatest library of sacred books. To do so, you need to have both the workers and resources to run a well-functioning scriptorium. To acquire workers and resources, you use a limited supply of donated gold. In addition, you must be on good terms with the powerful bishop, who can help you in your quest.<br/><br/>OUTLINE OF GAME PLAY<br/>The object of the game is to score the most Victory Points. You win Victory Points by winning any of the 5 categories: Illuminators, Scribes, Manuscripts, Scrolls, and Supplies. You win a category by having the highest total number of workers (Scribes, Illuminators) or resources (Manuscripts, Scrolls, Supplies) in that category. This is determined by the numbers in the upper left corner on the cards. At the start of the game, each category is worth 3 Victory Points. As the game progresses, the values on the Value Board will change and some categories will become worth more or less Victory Points than others. The game is divided into 2 stages: a Donation stage and an Auction stage. During the Donation stage, players acquire free cards according to an established plan. In the Auction stage, players purchase cards in auction rounds. After the two stages, winners of each category are determined and Victory Points awarded. The player with the most Victory Points wins.<br/><br/>GAME CHARACTERISTICS<br/>The game involves a good deal of strategic planning, some bluffing, and a little bit of luck. The rules are easy to understand, but you have to play it a few times to develop a playing strategy. It plays differently from 2-4 players, but each game is equally fun and challenging.<br/><br/>CONTENTS<br/><br/>     1 Value Board<br/>     5 Dice<br/>     87 Playing Cards<br/>     2 Reference Cards <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 
Big Boggle is a timed word game where players attempt to find as many connected words as possible from the face up letters resting in a 25 cube grid. When the timer runs out, players compare their list or words and remove any shared words. Points are then awarded for remaining words, depending on how many letters are in the word.<br/><br/>Big Boggle is similar to the standard Boggle, but with the following changes:<br/><br/>    uses a 5x5 grid of letters instead of 4x4<br/>    the minimum word size is changed to 4 letters instead of 3<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 
BISIKLE is a flicking game. The players have to compete on a crazy track in order to win a bicycle race. No cards or electrical devices are involved. The whole concept is in the ZBall, a marble with a unique internal mechanism. It is very easy to control. Basically, the goal of the game is to flick your way to the finish line as fast as possible.<br/><br/>The challenge is to control the effects of the ZBall and pass as fast as possible through all the obstacles (slopes, fences, jumps, mouse holes, etc.).<br/>Bisikle is the first of many ZBall games and was published in 2009 (September) in France and the USA. A track has to be built and looks like the slot-race ones.<br/><br/>

Blokus (pronounced &quot;Block us&quot;) is an abstract strategy game with transparent, Tetris-shaped, colored pieces that players are trying to play onto the board.  The only caveat to placing a piece is that it may not lie adjacent to your other pieces, but instead must be placed touching at least one corner of your pieces already on the board.<br/><br/>There is a solitaire variation where one player tries to get rid of all the pieces in a single sitting.<br/><br/>There are unauthorized versions of the game published under various names, including The Strategy Game, Tetris, Blok&aacute;d (unofficial Hungarian version with cardboard pieces) and The Family Chess Game.<br/><br/>Other Flavors:<br/><br/>     Blokus Trigon<br/>     Travel Blokus (2-player version)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/>    Blokus (real-time)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 
Travel Blokus is the smaller, 2-player verson of Blokus. It is an abstract strategy game with transparent, tetris-shaped, colored pieces that players are trying to play onto the board. The only caveat to placing a piece is that it may not lie adjacent to your other pieces, but instead must be placed touching at least one corner of your pieces already on the board.<br/><br/>The tiles in the Blokus To Go version are made with square holes cut into them that allow them to be snapped onto square-shaped &quot;nubs&quot; on the playing field. There are also two storage trays that hold the tiles for travel. These trays cover the board when the game is not being played and fold open in order for players to access the tiles.<br/><br/> 
Bohnanza is the first in the Bohnanza family of games and has been published in several different editions.<br/><br/>As card games go, this one is quite revolutionary.  Perhaps its oddest feature is that you cannot rearrange your hand, as you need to play the cards in the order that you draw them.  The cards are colorful depictions of beans in various descriptive poses, and the object is to make coins by planting fields (sets) of these beans and then harvesting them.  To help players match their cards up, the game features extensive trading and deal making.<br/><br/>The original German edition supports 3-5 players.<br/><br/>The newest English version is from Rio Grande Games and it comes with the first edition of the first German expansion included in a slightly oversized box.  One difference in the contents, however, is that bean #22's Weinbrandbohne (Brandy Bean) was replaced by the Wachsbohne, or Wax Bean.  This edition includes rules for up to seven players, like the Erweiterungs-Set, but also adapts the two-player rules of Al Cabohne in order to allow two people to play Bohnanza.<br/><br/>Note: As mentioned above, the Rio Grande Games edition supports more players than the Amigo release, and also sports two-player rules.  You should keep that in mind when perusing the ratings.<br/><br/>Expanded By:<br/><br/>     Mutabohn<br/>     Bohnanza Erweiterungs-Set<br/>     La Isla Bohnitâ<br/>     High Bohn<br/>     Bohnanza Erweiterungs-Set (Revised Edition)<br/>     High Bohn: Bohnenduell um 12 Uhr mittags<br/>     Ladybohn<br/>     High Bohn Plus<br/>     Bohnaparte<br/>     Dschingis Bohn<br/>     Bohnanza Counters<br/>     Bohnanza: Amigo Bohnentaler<br/>     Bohnröschen<br/>     Telebohn<br/>     Auf der schwäb'schen Eisenbohn<br/>     Bohnanza: Spiderbeans<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 
This game was originally published by AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH as Flinke Pinke. This game is one of those 'painfully simple' Reiner Knizia games. There are five different colored chips, with six cards, zero through five, in each of the colors.  The cards are dealt out, and then players take turns playing a card and taking any available chip.  When one color has all six cards played on it, then the game is over, and players use the last card played in each category to value their chips.  The highest total value wins.<br/><br/>Description of 1994 Milton Bradley re-issue Quandary, for 2-4 players:<br/><br/>A game of placement, shares and nerve by Reiner Knizia, this is a lovely edition with nice, heavy tiles akin to Mah-jong pieces in weight and feel. Players in turn lay numbered pieces on tracks curling to the centre, and then take a share in any colour. The round ends when a track is filled. Scoring is based on your total share multiplied by the value of the final tile played on each track. So if you are collecting blue shares, I'll try and lay a blue 1 as near last as possible. Then you'll want to play a blue 5 to raise your possible score, but must take a share in a different colour. Same game, different production.<br/><br/>Description of 2003 Fantasy Flight Games re-issue, Loco!, for 2-4 players:<br/><br/>Here is the FOURTH version of the game that was originally Flinke Pinke only this time, the added &quot;rule&quot; is that whenever you play a card with a value of &quot;0&quot;, you must say &quot;Loco!&quot; aloud or forfeit your opportunity to select one of the colored chips.  Apart from that, the game is identical.<br/><br/>Description of 2010 Gryphon Games games re-issue, Botswana, for 2-5 players:<br/><br/>This fifth version of the game adds a safari theme. Rules and gameplay are unchanged from the original version (no rules about animal noises), but the chips are replaced by plastic animal figures and the cards are covered in matching animal fur patterns.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Thor<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 
A version of Cranium &quot;scaled down&quot; somewhat for kids, although the game should still appeal to adults who like Cranium.  Here's the manufacturer's hype:<br/><br/>&quot;With a variety of hilarious activities, Cranium Cadoo gets kids thinking, creating, giggling, grinning, and laughing like crazy as they try to get four in a row to win. With so many different activities, there is something in Cranium Cadoo that will make every kid hoot and high-five.

&quot;What's that game with these cute little figures?&quot;<br/>&quot;You mean meeples?&quot;<br/>&quot;Yes, I see them everywhere on the Geek!&quot;<br/>&quot;They are from Carcassonne.&quot;<br/><br/>Carcassonne is a tile-placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of his meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.<br/><br/>During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete his project and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.<br/><br/>Part of the Carcassonne series.<br/><br/> 
The Spiel des Jahres-winning, genre-defining, spinoff-inducing tile-laying game Carcassonne turns ten in 2011, and naturally it's time for a celebration.<br/><br/>To mark the occasion, publisher Hans im Gl&uuml;ck is releasing Carcassonne Jubil&auml;umsedition, a special edition of the game packaged in a giant blue meeple-shaped case that includes the original game, ten new land tiles and colored translucent meeples.<br/><br/>The German version is expected to be released in February 2011.

Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers is a game in the Carcassonne series set in the stone age. Players build a prehistoric landscape with tiles depicting forests, rivers, lakes and grasslands.

Additionally, each player gets a &quot;big meeple&quot; which counts as two regular meeples.  Another whole set of meeples means 6 players can now enjoy the game.  Finally, a set of scoring cards helps make score-keeping a little clearer.<br/><br/>Part of the Carcassonne series.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     BrettspielWelt (real-time)<br/>     Aso Brain Games (real-time)<br/><br/><br/> 
Carcassonne: The Phantom consists of 6 transparent phantoms in 6 colors. The purple phantom is for the gray player.<br/><br/>Rules <br/>Each player gets a phantom of his player color. When placing a follower on a tile, the player may also place his phantom as an additional follower on the same tile. When both the follower and the phantom occupy the same tile, they must be placed on two different features. When the player gets his phantom back from scoring, he may keep it to use in a later turn. The phantom can also be placed by itself, and always counts as a regular follower.<br/><br/>Carcassonne: The Phantom will be available in German beginning in March 2011, with a worldwide release in April. The set will be released in 36-expansion boxes with 6 different colored transparent meeple-shaped boxes to choose from.<br/><br/>Part of the Carcassonne series.<br/><br/>

In fact, gamers have been predicting the release of this title for at least five years, and now is the time.<br/><br/>As part of the tenth anniversary celebrations for the Spiel des Jahres-winning Carcassonne, publisher Hans im Gl&uuml;ck and designers Klaus-J&uuml;rgen Wrede and Olivier Lamontagne are releasing Carcassonne: Das W&uuml;rfelspiel, a quick-playing dice game that will allow players to build cities faster than ever before.

The children have big fun to catch the animals before dusk.<br/><br/>The players in turn draw a landscape tile and place it; unlike in normal Carcassonne, they always match. Amongst other features, the tiles show children in the player colors on the roads.

The second major expansion to the original game of Carcassonne, Traders &amp; Builders contains 24 tiles with new features such as Bridges and Cities.<br/><br/>Some tiles also feature symbols for the goods Wine, Cloth and Wheat. Players collect one of these goods when the feature that has it on the tile is scored. Players with the most of each type of good gets bonus points at the end of the game. There are also two new wooden playing pieces in this expansion.  The Builder is like a meeple in that it may be placed in a city or road as a kind of supervisor. A subsequent tile extension of the feature the Builder is it allows the player another tile placement. Farmers will also be able to place a new Pig pawn in a field for extra points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Finally, Traders &amp; Builders comes with a large cloth bag.

<br/><br/><br/>    <br/>        <br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>A card game which involves a judge choosing a black question or fill-in-the-blank card.  Each player holds a hand of ten cards at the beginning of each round, and each player contributes card(s) to the &quot;card czar&quot; anonymously.  The card czar determines which card(s) are funniest in the context of the question or fill-in-the-blank card.<br/><br/>The player who submitted the chosen card(s) is given the question card to represent an &quot;Awesome Point.&quot;<br/><br/>In addition, there are a few extra rules.  First, some question cards are &quot;Pick 2&quot; or  cards, which require each participant to submit two cards in sequence to complete their answer. Second, a gambling component also exists.  If a question is played which a player believes they have two possible winning answers for, they may pay in an Awesome Point to play a single second answer.  If the player who gambled wins, they retain the wagered point, but if they lose, the player who contributed the winning answer takes both points.<br/><br/>After each round, the role of card czar rotates around the table, and play continues until everyone decides to stop.<br/> From the website:<br/><br/>&quot;Cards Against Humanity is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike license - that means you can use and remix the game for free, but you can't sell it.<br/><br/>Feel free to contact us at cardsagainsthumanity@gmail.com.&quot;<br/><br/> 
Cartagena takes as its theme the famous 1672 pirate-led jailbreak from the fortress of Cartagena. Each player has a group of six pirates and the objective is to have all six escape through the tortuous underground passage that connects the fortress to the port, where a sloop is waiting for them.<br/><br/>Each card bears one of six symbols (dagger, pirate hat, etc.), and you move a pirate forward by playing a card and moving ahead to the matching symbol in the tunnel, leapfrogging over those where another pirate already stands, but the only way to get more cards is to move backwards.  This turns into a simple but smart game of patience and opportunity, well received by casual gamers.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Cartagena II<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>In the same series:<br/><br/>    Cartagena III: Die Goldinsel<br/>    Cartagena IV: Die Meuterei<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

Once upon a time ...<br/>1289. To strengthen the borders of the Kingdom of France, King Philip the Fair decided to have a new castle built.

The general theme and mechanics are similar to the original boardgame. However, there is no board or score track and the tactical nuts and bolts of the game are somewhat different. In terms of components, the game consists of cards, money, worker pawns, resource markers, the provost, and castle building stones. Each player has a set of identical cards, which are shuffled and used as a face-down draw deck. Players start with an opening random draw of cards, and on his turn a player can either:<br/><br/><br/>    extend the road by building a new building <br/>    pay 1 to draw a new building card <br/>    pay 1 to discard his hand and draw a fresh hand (with the discard deck being shuffled for a new draw deck once the draw deck is exhausted) <br/>    pay 1 to place a worker on one of the existing building cards <br/>    build one of the common prestige building cards (some of which are placed at the beginning of the game as part of the setup) or <br/>    pass<br/><br/><br/>Once everyone has passed, the cards are resolved up to the provost (which can be moved in passing order by paying money).<br/><br/>Ownership of the non-common buildings is shown by the card color. When a worker is placed on a card, the owner earns either resources or money as a reward instead of victory points. Players may also choose to help build the castle. Starting with the first player to have passed, players can pay resources to obtain castle stones. The stones are worth three different values (2-4 points). Players collect the most valuable ones first. In addition, the player who collects the most building stones each round is rewarded with a gold resource marker.<br/><br/>From round to round, 1st player privileges rotate to the left, and the provost starts two cards further down the path from the castle.<br/><br/>The winner of the game is the player who has accumulated the most victory points once the game end has been triggered the turn the castle is finished. Victory points are awarded for castle stones, cards built, and resources and money in hand at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Description from BoardgameNews.com.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>     Caylus<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Ystari Box<br/>    Caylus Magna Carta: The Library<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

Players seek to build a collection of districts worth from one to eight points.  Once someone has built eight districts, the game is over after that round ends, and the player with the highest total value wins.  However, to facilitate the process (and make the game interesting), players sequentially choose a character from a rapidly dwindling pool of eight each turn.  The characters give players special abilities for the turn.<br/><br/>Citadels had a separate expansion, Citadels:  The Dark City Expansion, but the new (3rd Edition) Fantasy Flight editions come with the expansion included  (the Hans im Gl&uuml;ck tin box also included it).  With the newer version that includes Dark City, or the Dark City expansion purchased separately, this game can take 2 to 8 players.<br/><br/>A second edition of the German version of the game came in a tin box and included the Dark City expansion as well as three additional cards.  It is separately listed at Citadels.<br/><br/> 
Designed by Bruno Cathala and Ludovic Maublanc, Cleopatra and the Society of Architects is a fun and engaging family game that includes a true, three-dimensional palace that players compete to build. Players strive to become the wealthiest of Cleopatra&rsquo;s architects by constructing the most magnificent and valuable parts of her palace.<br/><br/>Players, however, will be tempted to deal with shady characters and trade in materials of dubious origins in order to help them build faster. While these corrupt practices might allow an architect to stay a step ahead of the rest, they come with a high price &ndash; cursed Corruption Amulets honoring Sobek, the Crocodile-god. When Cleopatra finally strolls into her new palace, at the end of the game, the most corrupt architect (the one with the most amulets) will be seized and offered as a sacrifice to her sacred crocodile! Only then will the wealthiest architect, from among those still alive, be selected and declared the winner of the game.<br/><br/>&ldquo;The component design in Cleopatra is the most innovative we&rsquo;ve undertaken to date,&rdquo; said Days of Wonder CEO, Eric Hautemont. &ldquo;While it&rsquo;s still a board game, the dozens of 3D pieces &ndash; Column walls, Doorframes, Obelisks, Sphinxes, and Palace Throne &ndash; all create the sense that you&rsquo;re constructing a royal palace.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;The game play really forces players into continually weighing the risks and rewards between taking enough corruption to enhance your position in the game, but not so much that you are forced out of the game at the end,&rdquo; said the game&rsquo;s co-designer, Bruno Cathala. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a classic &lsquo;push your luck&rsquo; dilemma that continually raises the tension level higher and higher until the game reaches its climax.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Description from the publisher.<br/><br/> 
From the rules:<br/>Freddy the Piglet has a difficult task, because lots of tasty tidbits are hidden in the forest and he  has to keep an eye on them all.<br/>The squirrels in the Hazelnut Gang are up to their usual mischief, however, and have also taken an  interest in the crunchy hazelnuts, juicy berries, chestnuts and fir cones. <br/>Your task is to be the first to steal 7 tidbits from under Freddy&rsquo;s nose! Whoever manages this will be the new leader of the HAZELNUT GANG!<br/><br/>Players move their squirrels on the board and then rotate the board on top of the box. When rotating the board, metal food tiles may click to the magnetic squirrels. The game is very simple and suitable for children aged four or more.<br/><br/> 
The classic detective game!  In Clue, players move from room to room in a mansion to solve the mystery of: who done it, with what, and where?  Players are dealt character, weapon, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the confidential file in the middle of the board.  Players must move to a room and then make an accusation against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific weapon.  The player to the left must show one of any cards accused to the accuser if in that player's hand.  Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, weapon, and location are in the secret file.  To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more accusations.  Once a player knows what cards the other players are holding they will know what cards are in the secret file.  A great game for those who enjoy reasoning and thinking things out.<br/><br/> 
Connect 4 is a well known vertical game played with &quot;checkers&quot; (it is more akin to Tic Tac Toe or Go Moku).<br/><br/>The board is placed in the stand to hold it vertically and the players drop checkers into one of the 7 slots, each of which holds 6 of the &quot;checker's&quot; men, until one player succeeds in getting 4 in a row--horizontally, vertically or diagonally.<br/><br/>The game is actually non-proprietary and nicer adult versions can be found under the name The Captain's Mistress.<br/><br/>

From Dunwich to Innsmouth, from the halls of Miskatonic University to the Charles Dexter Ward at Arkham Asylum, trouble is in the air. The stars are almost right, and terrors from beyond space and time are beginning to break through. When Cthulhu rises, we're all doomed &ndash; but whose downfall will be the most entertaining?<br/><br/>Cthulhu Gloom takes the game play of Atlas' Gloom and puts a Lovecraftian spin on it. Each player controls a group of protagonists, and your goal is to make them as miserable and insane as possible &ndash; preferably with them dying quickly while your opponents' heroes remain sane and (at a minimum) alive. In the publisher's description: &quot;While your characters Gibber With Ghouls and Learn Loathsome Lore to earn negative points, you'll encourage your opponents to be Analyzed by Alienists and to Just Forget About the Fungus to pile on positive points. When one group finally falls prey to the interdimensional doom that awaits us all, the player whose characters have suffered the most wins.&quot;<br/><br/>As in Gloom, the cards in Cthulhu Gloom are transparent, allowing you to stack multiple modifier cards on a character card to alter its stats or undo what an opponent has done to you. While Cthulhu Gloom can be played on its own or combined with Gloom and its many expansions, it does introduce two new types of cards:<br/><br/>&bull; Story cards can be in play from the start of the game, and the first player to meet a Story card's conditions &ndash; e.g., drawing the attention of The King in Yellow or heeding The Call of Cthulhu &ndash; claims the card and gains its benefits (or drawbacks).<br/><br/>&bull; Transformation cards mutate a character for the remainder of the game, no matter which modifiers might come its way later. What's more, the character's image is replaced with &quot;something hideous and slimy&quot;. You'd expect no less really...<br/><br/> 
This is a game that comes in a real egg-box. There are nine yellow plastic eggs and one yellow wooden egg (worth 2 points, the others are worth 1 point) and two dice, one red and one white. Although it is, in fact, a children's game, it is great fun when played by adults as well.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to accumulate the most points. First a player rolls the red die. Depending on the result of the die roll, players can:  attempt to be the first to take an egg from the box (or steal from someone else if there are none left in the box); drop an egg on the table and then compete to catch it; or even get up and run around the table to try to be the first back to their seat. When a player successfully wins an egg, he or she then rolls the white die, which indicates the location of the egg; between your cheek and your shoulder, your chin and the breast, between your knees, etc. When the first person drops an egg, the game ends and the one having the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>Ages 5 and up<br/><br/> 
Each player gets a cup with five poker dice and eight dollars. Each turn a player will put together a poker hand and depending on the roll, take control of various key places in Dice Town that will allow him to perform the corresponding action of the location.<br/><br/>In a turn, all players shake their cup and take out all but one die which is kept apart. They repeat the process with the remaining dice until all five dice are on the table. Players may want to keep more than one die; they pay one dollar for each additional die.<br/><br/>Now the locations are checked...<br/><br/>Nines: In the gold mine, the player with the most 9's may take one nugget from the mine for each nine he has thrown.<br/><br/>Tens: In the bank, the player with the most 10's may rob the bank and take all bills there - each two bills represent one victory point at game end.<br/><br/>Jacks: The player who has the most J's goes to the general store and draws as many cards as he had thrown J's, keeping one. These cards may give from one to eight points, or entitle a player to perform the saloon or general store action twice in a row, place a die with a result of a player's choice under the cup without rolling, or steal 4 dollars from another player. There are many more cards of this kind that spice up the game.<br/><br/>Queens: The player with the most Q's in his roll wins the favor of the girls, and takes advantage of their charm to steal from an opponent. He may take as many cards from his opponent as he has thrown Q's, keeping one and giving back the others.<br/><br/>Kings: The player with the most K's becomes the new sheriff; he decides who wins in any ties, but the sheriff can be influenced with nuggets, cards or money.<br/><br/>Aces/Poker hand: In the town hall the player with the best poker hand gets a property claim worth from one to five victory points. Having aces in the best poker hand permits taking additional cards.<br/><br/>Finally, if a player did not win anything during a turn, he might visit Doc Badluck where he can choose any one of the following:<br/>- equip oneself with barbed wire - the player has two property claims that cannot be stolen;<br/>- draw the first card from the general store pile;<br/>- all other players must give the player two dollars;<br/>- an ace will bring a nugget from every other player.<br/><br/>The game ends when there are no more gold nuggets in the mine or when all property claims have been issued. Players count their points: 1 for each nugget, 1 for every two dollars, 5 for whomever is currently sheriff, and each general store and property card for its value.<br/><br/> 
DIRTY MINDS  The Game of Naughty Clues... is also known as &quot;The world's cleanest dirty game.&quot; The dirtier a mind you have, the worse you will be at playing DIRTY MINDS because all of the answers are clean!<br/><br/>DIRTY MINDS will provide two or more adults with hours of laughter as seemingly filthy clues point towards the most innocent of answers. Some people say a dirty mind is a terrible thing to waste. Use yours to play DIRTY MINDS, but remember... NOTHING IS AS DIRTY AS IT SEEMS!<br/><br/>TEST HOW DIRTY YOUR MIND IS BY READING THE FOLLOWING CLUES:<br/>- I'm a four letter word. <br/>- I'm a name for a woman. <br/>- I end in u-n-t. <br/>------ What am I?<br/><br/> 
2010 Spiel des Jahres Winner<br/><br/>One player is the storyteller for the turn. He looks at the 6 images in his hand. From one of these, he makes up a sentence and says it out loud (without showing the card to the other players).<br/><br/>The other players select amongst their 6 images the one that best matches the sentence made up by the storyteller.<br/><br/>Then, each of them gives their selected card to the storyteller, without showing it to the others. The storyteller shuffles his card with all the received cards. All pictures are shown face up, randomly, and every player has to bet upon what picture was the storyteller's.<br/><br/>If nobody or everybody finds the correct picture, the storyteller scores 0, and each of the other players scores 2. Otherwise the storyteller and whoever found the correct answer scores 3. Players score 1 point for every vote gotten by their own picture.<br/><br/>The game ends when the deck is empty or if someone reaches 30 points,so he wins.Otherwise the greatest total wins the game.<br/><br/> 
Expansion for Dixit. 84 new cards with paintings that can be used on their own (but then you need some kind of voting tokens and paper and pencil to take notes of the scoring) or with those from the base game.<br/><br/>The game does not contain scoring board and tokens, but it will be packed in a smaller box in which it is much easier to take it on a trip. This game could theoretically be played as it is, but the components needed to play are contained in the base-game.<br/><br/>As in Dixit, each round, one player takes on the role of Storyteller who chooses one card from his hand, tells, sings or does something that in his opinion is associated with the played card. Other players choose their own cards. Then cards are shuffled and revealed, and players vote which card was played by Storyteller, and score points according to their guesses.<br/><br/>Player who has the most points wins the game.<br/><br/> 
Dixit Odyssey is both a standalone game and an expansion for Jean-Louis Roubira's Dixit, which won Germany's Spiel des Jahres award in 2010.<br/><br/>Game play in Dixit Odyssey matches that of Dixit: Each turn one player is the storyteller. This player secretly chooses one card in his hand, then gives a word or sentence to describe this card &ndash; but not too obviously. Each other player chooses a card in hand that matches this word/sentence and gives it to the storyteller. The storyteller then lays out the cards, and all other players vote on which card belongs to the storyteller. If no one or everyone guesses the storyteller's card, the storyteller receives no points and all players receive two; otherwise the storyteller and the correct guesser(s) each receive three points. Players score one point for each vote their image receives. Players refill their hands, and the next player becomes the storyteller. When the deck runs out, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Dixit Odyssey contains 84 new cards, each with a unique image drawn by Pier&ocirc; and colored by Marie Cardouat, artist of Dixit and Dixit 2. It also includes a folding game board, new rabbit scoring tokens, and a box large enough to hold all the Dixit cards released to date.<br/><br/>Dixit Odyssey includes enough components for up to twelve players and also has variant rules for team play and for new ways to play with the cards.<br/><br/>Integrates with:<br/><br/>    Dixit<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 
In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards.  In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can &quot;buy&quot; as they can afford them.  Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.<br/><br/>From the back of the box: &quot;You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion!

You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn't be proud, but your grandparents, on your mother's side, would be delighted.&quot;<br/><br/>Dominion is not a CCG, but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck.

Autumn. It seemed like the summer would never end, but that fortune teller was right. It's over. Autumn, the time of the harvest. Agriculture has advanced significantly in recent years, ever since the discovery of the maxim, &quot;leaves of three, let it be.&quot; Autumn, a time of celebration. The peasants have spent a hard week scything hay in the fields, but tonight the festivities begin, starting with a sumptuous banquet of roast hay. Then, the annual nose-stealing competition. Then you have two jesters, one who always lies, one who always tells the truth, both hilariously. Then, they fight to the death! This celebration will truly have something for everyone.<br/><br/>This is the 5th addition to the game of Dominion. It adds 13 new Kingdom cards to Dominion, plus 5 unique cards. The central theme is variety; there are cards that reward you for having a variety of cards in your deck, in your hand, and in play, as well cards that help you get that variety.<br/><br/>(Source: RGG Cornucopia page)<br/><br/>Part of the Dominion series.<br/><br/>This is an expansion not a full game, you will need either Dominion or Dominion Intrigue to be able to play this. There are no basic victory or treasure cards in this set.<br/><br/>The goal is as previously in the series to have the largest Dominion of all players, basically to have the most victory points. Players will build their decks as before by buying cards which offer varying benefits, the ultimate goal being to buy victory cards. In contrast to previous games of the series players will be rewarded for building a deck containing a variety of cards.<br/><br/> 
Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>The world is big and your kingdom small. Small when compared to the world, that is; it's moderate-sized when compared to other kingdoms. But in a big world like this one - big when compared to smaller worlds anyway, if such things exist; it's moderate-sized when compared to worlds of roughly the same size, and a little small when compared to worlds just a little larger - well, to make a long story short - short when compared to longer stories anyway - it is time to stretch your borders. You've heard of far-off places - exotic countries, where they have pancakes but not waffles, where the people wear the wrong number of shirts, and don't even have a word for the look two people give each other when they each hope that the other will do something that they both want done but which neither of them wants to do. It is to these lands that you now turn your gaze.<br/><br/>Dominion: Hinterlands is the sixth addition to the game of Dominion. It adds 26 new Kingdom cards to Dominion, including 20 Actions, 3 Treasures, 3 Victory cards, and 3 Reactions. The central theme is cards that do something immediately when you buy them or gain them.<br/><br/>Part of the Dominion series.<br/><br/> 
In Dominion: Intrigue (as with Dominion), each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can &quot;buy&quot; as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.<br/><br/>You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.<br/><br/>From the back of the box: &quot;Something's afoot. The steward smiles at you like he has a secret, or like he thinks you have a secret. There are secret plots brewing, you're sure of it. At the very least, there are yours. A passing servant murmurs 'The eggs are on the plate.' You frantically search your codebook for the translation before realizing he means that breakfast is ready. Excellent.<br/>Everything is going according to plan.&quot;<br/><br/>Dominion: Intrigue adds rules for playing with up to 8 players at two tables or for playing a single game with up to 6 players when combined with Dominion. This game adds 25 new Kingdom cards and a complete set of Treasure and Victory cards. The game can be played alone by players experienced in Dominion or with the basic game of Dominion.<br/><br/>Part of the Dominion series.<br/><br/>Integrates with:<br/><br/>    Dominion<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 
Released in late 2010, Prosperity is the 4th addition to the Dominion game family. It adds 25 new Kingdom cards to Dominion, plus 2 new Basic cards that let players keep building up past Gold and Province. The central theme is wealth; there are treasures with abilities, cards that interact with treasures, and powerful expensive cards. (Source: <a target='_blank' href="http://www.riograndegames.com/games.html?id=361" rel="nofollow">http://www.riograndegames.com/games.html?id=361</a> )<br/><br/>From the back of the box: &quot;Ah money. There's nothing like the sound of coins clinking in your hands. You vastly prefer it to the sound of coins clinking in someone else's hands, or the sound of coins just sitting there in a pile that no-one can quite reach without getting up. Getting up, that's all behind you now. Life has been good to you. Just ten years ago, you were tiling your own fields in a simple straw hat. Today, your kingdom stretches from sea to sea, and your straw hat is the largest the world has ever known. You also have the world's smallest dog, and a life-sized statue of yourself made out of baklava. Sure, money can't buy happiness, but it can buy envy, anger, and also this kind of blank feeling. You still have problems - troublesome neighbours that must be conquered. <br/>But this time, you'll conquer them in style.&quot;<br/><br/>Part of the Dominion series.<br/><br/> 
Dominion: Seaside is an expansion to both Dominion and Dominion: Intrigue. As such, it does not contain material for a complete game. Specifically, it does not include the basic Treasure, Victory, Curse, or Trash cards. Thus, you will need either the base game or Intrigue to play with this expansion, and you will need to have experience playing Dominion with either of the first two games. It is designed to work with either or both of these sets, and any future expansions that may be published.<br/><br/>From the back of the box: &quot;All you ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by. And someone who knows how to steer ships using stars. You finally got some of those rivers you'd wanted, and they led to the sea. These are dangerous, pirate-infested waters, and you cautiously send rat-infested ships across them, to establish lucrative trade at far-off merchant-infested ports. First, you will take over some islands, as a foothold. The natives seem friendly enough, crying their peace cries, and giving you spears and poison darts before you are even close enough to accept them properly. When you finally reach those ports you will conquer them, and from there you will look for more rivers.<br/>One day, all the rivers will be yours.&quot;<br/><br/>Part of the Dominion series.<br/><br/> 
Players move their workers around the board (which is composed of variable groups of hexes) building houses along the banks of two rivers. Each turn certain hexes along the river pay out, either in money (which you use to build houses) or lumber (used to make dams). The first player to construct all five of their buildings (four houses and one hacienda) or a hacienda and three houses that are all on a riverbank, wins. Players build dams to change the flow of the rivers.<br/><br/> 
Description from BoardgameNews.com:<br/><br/>Dragons, knights, trolls, princesses, dwarves and other fantasy characters make up the world of Drachenherz. Dragons are searching for treasure, of course, but they're being pursued by dragon hunters, and those are the two sides that face off in this game. On a turn, a player plays one or more cards with the same motif, then refills his hand to five cards. The cards are always played onto the part of the gameboard that has the same motif. By laying out cards, one collects point cards that are already present. This is how a dragon collects treasure cards &ndash; but the third dragon hunter defeats the dragon, while a second knight protects the princess. Other combinations await the players, and whoever collects the most points wins.<br/><br/>Drachenherz is part of the Kosmos two-player series.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     Yucata (turn-based)<br/><br/><br/> 
The game board is triangular. The players have round wooden disks and try to place them on the game board. In the beginning, this can be done in any position where a disk doesn't touch any other disk. When the board becomes too full, the disks must be placed on the edge of the board, then pushed in with a wooden bar. In this way, all other disks that are hanging over the edge of that particular edge of the board, are pushed back in as well. Disks that fall over an edge are returned to the player of the respective color. Neutral disks are handed to any player (black disks) or to the player whose turn it is (red disks). The first player to place all his/her disks on the board wins the game.<br/><br/>A small number of copies of Schiebung were published as a &quot;Test-Edition&quot; by Edition Perlhuhn in 2009.<br/><br/> 
Each player gets one of the four decks of 40 cards each.  Each deck has a different design on the back (carriage, pump, pail, and plow) to designate players cards.  Each player has three cards placed on the table in front of them (post piles) along with a pile of 10 cards (blitz pile).  Players try to form sequences of cards (in ascending order, by color) in the center of the table starting from one up to ten.  Quickest player to get rid of his blitz pile calls BLITZ and play stops.  Cards in center of table count for 1 point each, cards left in blitz pile count for -2 points each.  First player to 75 wins.<br/><br/>The LIGRETTO version was first published 1988 by Rosengarten, by Schmidt starting in 2000.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/><br/>     Ligretto Speed Machine<br/><br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     BrettspielWelt (real-time)<br/><br/><br/> 
DVONN is played on an elongated hexagonal board, with 23 white, 23 black and 3 red DVONN-pieces. In the beginning the board is empty. The players first place the DVONN-pieces on the board and next to their own pieces. Then they start stacking pieces on top of each other. A single piece may be moved 1 space in any direction, a stack of two pieces may be moved two spaces, etc. A stack must always be moved as a whole and a move must always end on top of another piece or stack. If pieces or stacks lose contact with the DVONN-pieces, they must be removed from the board. The game ends when no more moves can be made. The players put the stacks they control on top of each other and the one with the highest stack is the winner.<br/><br/>This game is part of project GIPF.<br/><br/> 
The players are builders in the Ancient Egypt, competing to get the most fame building different monuments requested by the Pharaoh (the Sphinx, the Obelisk, the Temple and the Pyramid).<br/><br/>The game lasts 5 turns. In each turn, the players place their pawns on the board, along the banks of the Nile, getting the advantages shown on each square. On the right bank there are fixed squares where the players may get workers, improve their mercantile capabilities, influence the floods (and thus the fertility of the fields) and reserve the right to build the monuments (that are built only after all the placements are done). On the left bank the players may take cards that are deployed randomly on the 10 squares at the start of each turn; some of these cards are kept until the end of the game (cultivable fields, stone quarries, deities granting special advantages), while others are discarded after the use and offer multiple immediate advantages.<br/><br/>In Egizia, the twist on the worker placement mechanic is that the players must place their pawns following the course of the Nile, moving northwards (from the top to the bottom of the board, that is seen from the Mediterranean Sea). In this way, each placement not only blocks the opponents from choosing the same square (except monuments, where multiple players are always allowed), but also forces the player to place his remaining pawns only on the squares below the one he just occupied (note that &quot;pawns&quot; are placed, since &quot;workers&quot; are one of the resources of the game, like grain and stones).<br/><br/>When the placement phase is over, the workers of the players must be fed with the grain produced in the fields. The production of each field is based on the floods of the Nile, so some fields may not give grain each turn. If a player has not enough grain for all his workers, he has to buy it with Victory Points (the ratio is better for players with improved mercantile capabilities, recorded on a specific track on the board).<br/><br/>After that, stones are received from the owned quarries and used to build the monuments (if the right to do was reserved earlier) along with the workers.<br/><br/>When the game ends, the points scored during the game (mainly building the monuments) are added to the bonuses obtained fulfilling certain conditions on the Sphinx cards. Whoever has the highest total is the winner.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     Yucata (turn-based)<br/><br/><br/> 
Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>It is 1926, and the museum's extensive collection of exotic curios and occult artifacts poses a threat to the barriers between our world and the elder evils lurking between dimensions. Gates to the beyond begin to leak open, and terrifying creatures of increasing strength steal through them. Animals, the mad, and those of more susceptible minds are driven to desperation by the supernatural forces the portals unleash. Only a handful of investigators race against time to locate the eldritch symbols necessary to seal the portals forever. Only they can stop the Ancient One beyond from finding its way to Earth and reducing humanity to cinders.<br/><br/>Elder Sign is a fast-paced, cooperative dice game of supernatural intrigue for one to eight players by Richard Launius and Kevin Wilson, the designers of Arkham Horror. Players take the roles of investigators racing against time to stave off the imminent return of the Ancient One. Armed with tools, allies, and occult knowledge, investigators must put their sanity and stamina to the test as they adventure to locate Elder Signs, the eldritch symbols used to seal away the Ancient Ones and win the game.<br/><br/>To locate Elder Signs, investigators must successfully endure Adventures within the museum and its environs. A countdown mechanism makes an Ancient One appear if the investigators are not quick enough. The investigators must then battle the Ancient One. A clever and thematic dice mechanism pits their exploration against monsters and the sheer difficulty of staying sane and healthy, all within the standard game duration of one to two hours.<br/><br/> 
Players attempt to help their moose across a river by flicking wooden disks into position so as to create 'stepping stones' from one end of the table to the other.  If you flick well, you'll be able to move your moose quicker than your opponent.  But you must be careful not to make the gap too large, as the miniature wooden moose can only span a relatively small distance.<br/><br/>Elchfest is part of the Kosmos two-player series.<br/><br/> 
FITS (Fill In The Spaces) is essentially a multi-player Tetris. Each player has an inclined board on which they place different polyominoes, with three, four, or five squares. Cards are drawn from a pile to tell the players which piece to take. The pieces may be rotated and reversed before they slide down the inclined area to dock to other gaming pieces, but unlike Tetris cannot be slid horizontally once dropped. Scoring is based on quantity and configuration of squares left uncovered.<br/><br/>Unlike original Tetris there is no time pressure but like Tetris every player is engaged with his own board.<br/><br/>Official expansion:<br/><br/><br/>     FITS Official Expansion<br/><br/><br/>Unofficial expansions:<br/><br/><br/>     FITS Expansion #1: MOTS: More Of The Same <br/>     FITS Expansion #2: LOTS: Letters On The Spaces<br/>     FITS Expansion #3: BOTS: Big Obnoxious Terrible Spaces<br/><br/><br/>Reimplemented by:<br/><br/><br/>     Mini FITS <br/><br/><br/> 
Fluxx is a card game in which the cards themselves determine the current rules of the game.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player holds three cards and on a turn a player draws one card, then plays one card. By playing cards, you can put new rules into play that change numerous aspects of the game: how many cards to draw or play, how many cards you can hold in hand or keep on the table in front of you, and (most importantly) how to win the game. There are many editions, themed siblings, and promo cards available.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Jewish Fluxx<br/>    Fluxx 10th Anniversary Party Promos<br/>    Fluxx Blanxx<br/>    Christian Fluxx<br/>    Fluxx Promo Cards<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 
For Sale is a quick, fun game nominally about buying and selling real estate. During the game's two distinct phases players first bid for several buildings, then, after all buildings have been bought, sell the buildings for the greatest profit possible.<br/><br/>The Überplay 2005 Edition has new art, rules and card distribution changes, and it accommodates 3-6 players.<br/><br/>The Gryphon 2009 Edition uses the &Uuml;berplay art for the faces of the property cards, while replacing most other art.  The rules are the same as the &Uuml;berplay edition, with the exception of the rounding rule.<br/><br/>

This game is played in several hands. In each hand the players try to be the first to get rid of all of their cards. Their scores are based on how early in the hand they get rid of all their cards. There are two ways to play: you can play where all hands are played the same, or you can play the game with changing partners.<br/><br/>This is a climbing game, similar to The Great Dalmuti, Tichu, and others.  The difference here is that the ranks are different kinds of colorfully illustrated animals. Each is scared away only by certain other animals.  Players set out one to whatever cards of a particular variety, and someone can play onto that pile only if they have more of that animal or an equal number of some animal that can scare it away.  Players get points by playing all their cards, collecting lions, and collecting a hedgehog.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href="http://doris-frank.de/Games4.html" rel="nofollow">http://doris-frank.de/Games4.html</a><br/><br/>

Garibaldi: La Trafila is a boardgame that makes you live the events which occurred in august 1849, near Ravenna (Romagna, Italy), when Garibaldi, hunted by the Austrians for fifteen days, succeeded to hide in valleys and in pine forests to reach salvation. A player is Garibaldi in hiding, the others are the Austrian patrols hunting him. Garibaldi wins if he succeeds in reaching the safe point and can run away, otherwise the Austrian patrols win if they catch Garibaldi.<br/><br/>In turns, using the cards, it's possible to move on the gameboard, a big-sized board that reproduces accurately a map of the territory at that time. The player who controls Garibaldi, with the help of a special screen, makes his moves secretly, while the other players have to work together to stop the moves of the escaper, trying to find him.<br/><br/>Garibaldi: La Trafila is a game of deduction and bluff, recommended for all families: the rules are simple, but the gameplay stimulates reasoning and cooperation, offering the possibility for expert players to adopt more refined strategies.<br/><br/> 
GiftTRAP won a special Spiel des Jahres prize in 2009, and was voted &quot;Best Party Game of the Year&quot; by Games Magazine in 2008, proving that while buying real gifts can be traumatic, giving virtual gifts to find out how people really feel is heaps of fun. Be prepared for some surprises!<br/><br/>It's a conversation starter that will get you and your friends talking about things that matter. Unlike other party games you don't need skills in drawing, acting or trivia, so it works well when you have a crowd of mixed ages/skills.<br/><br/>GiftTRAP is played over a series of rounds. Each round has the following steps:<br/><br/><br/>     DEAL - deal random gifts from one of the 5 packs of gifts. Packs have similar monetary value.<br/>     SHOP - think about how to match these gifts to the players.<br/>     GIVE - give one of these gifts to each player (using gift tokens).<br/>     GET - choose which gifts you want yourself (using get tokens: Ok, Good, Great &amp; No Way).<br/>     REVEAL - show people what you wanted and see what you were given by each player.<br/>     SCORE - the giver and the receiver score for each gift (the giver gets GIVING points, the receiver gets GETTING points). <br/><br/><br/>The first to reach the end of both the Giving and Getting tracks is the winner.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/>     <a target='_blank' href="http://live.gifttrap.com/en/play" rel="nofollow">http://live.gifttrap.com/en/play</a> (played via email)<br/>     <a target='_blank' href="http://apps.facebook.com/gifttrap/" rel="nofollow">http://apps.facebook.com/gifttrap/</a> (played on Facebook via notifications)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 
Each player represents the leadership of a 17th century Scottish clan looking to expand its territory and its wealth. The success of your clan depends on your ability to make the correct decision at the opportune time, be it by establishing a new pasture for your livestock, growing grain for the production of whisky, selling your goods on the various markets, or investing in the cultivation of special places such as lochs and castles.<br/><br/>Glen More offers a unique turn mechanism. Players take territory tiles from a rondell. Picking a tile has not only influence on the actions you get by the surrounding tiles in your territory, it also determines when you'll have your next turn (and how many turns you will have in the game). But having a lot of turns is not always the best strategy for a successful chieftain.<br/><br/>Glen More is 6 in the Alea medium box series, and is rated a 4 on the alea complexity level.<br/><br/> 
From the publisher, Atlas Games:<br/><br/>The world of Gloom is a sad and benighted place. The sky is gray, the tea is cold, and a new tragedy lies around every corner. Debt, disease, heartache, and packs of rabid flesh-eating mice&mdash;just when it seems like things can't get any worse, they do. But some say that one's reward in the afterlife is based on the misery endured in life. If so, there may yet be hope&mdash;if not in this world, then in the peace that lies beyond.<br/><br/>In the Gloom card game, you assume control of the fate of an eccentric family of misfits and misanthropes. The goal of the game is sad, but simple: you want your characters to suffer the greatest tragedies possible before passing on to the well-deserved respite of death. You'll play horrible mishaps like Pursued by Poodles or Mocked by Midgets on your own characters to lower their Self-Worth scores, while trying to cheer your opponents' characters with marriages and other happy occasions that pile on positive points. The player with the lowest total Family Value wins.<br/><br/>Printed on transparent plastic cards, Gloom features an innovative design by noted RPG author Keith Baker. Multiple modifier cards can be played on top of the same character card; since the cards are transparent, elements from previously played modifier cards either show through or are obscured by those played above them. You'll immediately and easily know the worth of every character, no matter how many modifiers they have. You've got to see (through) this game to believe it!<br/><br/>Each of the three expansions for Gloom adds one more player, thus with all three expansions, this should be playable with seven players.<br/><br/> 
The expansion adds one player and 55 cards to the game. Here is a description of the expansion from the publisher:<br/><br/>The Game of Inauspicious Incidents and Grave Consequences<br/><br/>In the Gloom card game, you make your eccentric family of misfits suffer the greatest tragedies possible before helping them pass on to the well-deserved respite of death. Just mix the 55 transparent cards in this set together with your copy of Gloom to add morbid new Modifiers, Events, and Untimely Deaths, and a new family of intrepid explorers who've faced misfortune across the globe. These days Colonel Bumpersnoot is really more of a bargain hunter, while Lady Bumpersnoot struggles with high society -- but she always loves to have guests for dinner. Their Towering Treehouse is included as a Residence card to use with the Unhappy Homes expansion.<br/><br/>Unfortunate Expeditions introduces expeditions into the game. Only one expedition can be in play at a time. An expedition's rules affect all players as long as it remains in play. When you play a modifier of untimely death that has an expedition symbol, resolved the immediate effects of the card, then replace the current expedition with the one shown on the card. Some cards also have special effects that occur if an active expedition is already in play when the card is played.<br/><br/> 
The expansion adds one player and 55 cards to the game. Here is a description of the expansion from the publisher:<br/><br/>In the Gloom card game, you make your eccentric family of misfits suffer the greatest tragedies possible before helping them pass on to the well-deserved respite of death. Just mix the 55 transparent cards included in this set together with your copy of Gloom to add morbid new Modifiers, Events, and Untimely Deaths, and a new family -- the artistes of Le Canard Noir, whose creative endeavors always end in disaster.<br/><br/>When art lets you down, the Black Duck is there for you. This dingy cafe is home to a motley assortment of washed-up bohemians. Here the tormented painter Rosseau buys drinks for neurotic models and destitute poets, while a troubled actress and sickly courtesan compare notes across the way.<br/><br/>Also included are five Residences with a light blue background behind their central illustration. These are each placed next to their related family at the start of the game. New cards called Mysteries, which have a dark blue effects bar at the bottom, are also shuffled into the deck before play. A Mystery is the only card that can be placed on a Residence (and only a Residence), and can be placed on any Residence as either of your two plays. It gives that Residence's player a special effect and Pathos points that count toward his final Family Value. A Mystery remains even if the requirements for playing it are lost. You may discard a Mystery from your hand as a free play.<br/><br/> 
The expansion adds one player and 55 cards to the game. Here is a description of the expansion from the publisher:<br/><br/>In the Gloom card game, you make your eccentric family of misfits suffer the greatest tragedies possible before helping them pass on to the well-deserved respite of death. Just mix the 55 transparent cards in this new set together with your copy of Gloom to add morbid new Modifiers, Events, and Untimely Deaths, and a new family - the malodorous Malone mob - including The Broken Arms Hotel as a Residence card to use with the Unhappy Homes expansion. When Boils Malone brought his family overseas to &ldquo;get away from the heat,&rdquo; he wasn&rsquo;t expecting quite so much rain!<br/><br/>Adding an extra level of strategy, new persistent effect icons on cards allow their special effects to continue to be active even if covered by another card. A persistent effect ends only when the attached character is killed.<br/><br/>Also inside are five Unwelcome Guest cards. Deal one or more face up to the table&rsquo;s center at the start of the game. Guests &ldquo;follow&rdquo; the card types noted on them; no matter where it currently is, a living Guest immediately moves to join the family of the character on which one of its &ldquo;trigger&rdquo; cards is played. All its Modifiers are moved with it, and it&rsquo;s considered a member of that family until it moves again. This may delay the game&rsquo;s end if a final play draws a Guest to the near-winner&rsquo;s family<br/><br/> 
Who is the best angler?<br/><br/>One player takes the role of the two anglers and tries to catch as many fish as possible. The other player takes the role of the fish and with bluff and skill tries to hinder the anglers from catching fish. The angler player decides where to fish, but must do so in the dark (that is, he cannot really see where the fish are), as the fish cards are placed face down. Because of this, he does not know whether he is catching a fish or garbage. Also, when he is lucky enough to catch a fish, he will not know until he lands it how valuable it is. With clever movement of his fish, the fish player tries to get garbage and small fish onto the anglers hooks.<br/><br/>After one game, the players switch roles. After two games, the player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>Gone Fishing! is part of the Kosmos two-player series.<br/><br/> 
From the Manufacturer:<br/>It's the same classic game of Guess Who? but with tons of fun extras. This deluxe version of Guess Who has 6 different character themes and 120 new characters to play with. An electric timer, light, and sounds also accompany the fun. All game pieces are contained in the new compact case so kids can bring their gaming fun on the go. Requires two 1.5V AAA or R03 size batteries- not included. Ages 6 and up.<br/><br/> 
This game is like Charades on 'Speed'. The active player gets four cards. Each card has two words on it, one easy, one difficult. The harder the word, the more points it's worth. The player picks one word from each card and loads them into the timer device. S/he then has about a minute to communicate the words to teammates; when a word is guessed correctly, the card must be snatched out of the timer. The timer, meanwhile, will &quot;eat&quot; the cards, one at a time, if they aren't snatched. You get points for each card successfully rescued from the timer.<br/><br/>Reimplemented with different rules: Electronic Guesstures<br/><br/> 
The French Revolution is famous in part for the use of the guillotine to put nobles to death, and this is the macabre subject of this light card game.  As executioners pandering to the masses, the players are trying to behead the least popular nobles.  Each day the nobles are lined up and players take turns killing the ones at the front of the line until all the nobles are gone.  However, players are given cards which will manipulate the line order right before 'harvesting,' which is what makes the game interesting.  After three days worth of chopping, the highest total carries the day.<br/><br/> 
In Habitat, your goal is to attract the most complex and diverse animal life to your portion of the great North Woods.  The most vibrant ecosystems are those that have organisms from all levels of life, from the producers up to the dominant predators.  Therefore, to win a game of Habitat, a player must create a complete collection of cards ranked 1-8.  Cards are stacked in order of rank, from lowest to highest, to form Food Chains.  There may be multiple Food Chains and duplicate ranks, but only one card from each rank is needed to win.  By contrast, an unsupported chain of cards carries the risk that creatures become hungry, or even begin to starve!  When a player has collected the necessary cards and all animals are fed, that player declares a &quot;Habitat&quot; and wins the game.<br/><br/> 
A speed action game in which players watch for sets of exactly 5 fruit.  There are 56 playing cards showing four kinds of fruit in groups of 1 to 5 and a bell of the type found at hotel reception desks. The deck is distributed evenly between the players. Hold your deck face down; deal one face up in front of you. As each player reveals their next card, the instant you see a total of five of one kind of fruit on the table, hit the bell. If you're correct, you pick up all the played cards and put them into your deck. If you're wrong, pay the others a card each. When you run out of cards, you're out. When 2 players are left, they have one more strike, and then the taller deck wins.<br/><br/>There is a trick to spotting five of a kind which players sometimes miss. Getting five of a kind occurs when cards are revealed, and also when they are covered. So if there were 3, 1 and 4 bananas showing, when the 3 is covered there are suddenly 5 bananas.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Halli Galli Extreme<br/>    Halli Galli Junior<br/>    Halli Galli Xmas Edition<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 
The hanging gardens were one of the 7 wonders of the ancient world, as all history courses teach. But, did they actually exist? Nothing remains of their reported splendor, which was built for the eyes of Amyitis.<br/><br/>Without an exact reference to follow, the 2-4 players will re-establish the hanging gardens according to their own tastes.<br/><br/>Card follows card with magnificent buildings, sparkling fountains, and exotic plants as the players work to rebuild the legendary gardens. In the end, the queen will be pleased and rewards the victory palm to the player whose work on the gardens most impresses her highness.<br/><br/> 
In Hey, That's My Fish!, players want to catch as many fish as possible with their waddle of penguins. Each turn, a player moves one penguin in a straight line over hex-shaped ice tiles with 1, 2 or 3 fish on them. The player then collects the hex from where the penguin started its movement from the table, thereby creating a gap which penguins can't cross on future turns. When a penguin can't move, it's removed from play with its owner claiming the tile on which it stands. The player who collects the most fish wins.<br/><br/>

In Reiner Knizia's High Society, players bid against each other to acquire the various trappings of wealth (positive-number and multiplier cards) while avoiding its pitfalls (negative number and divisor cards).

It must move exactly two on top of the Hive and then move one down on its last move. It may not move around the outside of the Hive and may not end its movement on top of the Hive.

A timed version of Cranium, designed for two or more players to play cooperatively.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt 4 cards depicting commonly known people, places, or objects. Another 8 cards are added to a common Play Pile. Players then take turns rolling a die to determine what type of clues can be given, starting the timer, selecting a card from their hand, and trying to get the other players to guess what is on that card as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>The four types of clues that can be given to describe your cards are:<br/><br/>    Cloodle - provide clues by drawing and doodling<br/>    Tongue-Tied - use alliteration to give as many clues as possible that start with a single letter<br/>    Soundstage - act out or provide sound effects for clues (but you can't use words!)<br/>    Tweener - give hints in the form &quot;It's bigger than blank but smaller than blank&quot;, using two objects that imply the answer<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>After someone guesses the card in play, stop the timer and draw a new card from the Play Pile. The next player takes the die and repeats the same process, until either no cards are left or the available 15 minutes are gone.<br/><br/>Players who are stuck on a particular card can choose to discard that card, but two new cards must then be added to the game instead - one card is placed directly in that player's hand, and a penalty card is added to the Play Pile.<br/><br/>The game is won by all players if they can work together to guess all of the cards in play before the timer runs out.<br/><br/> 
Hornet is an area control game with simultaneous action selection and a dual-layered resource system. The game board is a modular board built of hex tiles representing a landscape with fields of flowers and hornet nests of various sizes. The players have an identical deck of action cards and each card can be used multiple times. Each game turn, players secretly pick an action card that is revealed simultaneously with the other players. The actions are resolved in the numerical order of the action cards, with each player allocating the action to either one of their hornets on the game board. The hornets compete to collect nectar from the flower fields that is in turn used to produce honey in the nests. The winner of each hornet nest is resolved in a pre-determined order, with the winner being the player with the most honey in the nest. The game is won immediately by conquering three nests or by having won two nests by the end of the game with the highest aggregate amount of honey produced. The nature of the various action cards ensures high player interaction, causes a need for pre planning a number of turns ahead and allows the execution of cunning tactical moves. The easily comprehensible rules, variable game set-up and eye catching artwork with a cheerful theme facilitate an enduring and pleasant gaming experience.<br/><br/>Box back text:<br/>Hornet is a stinging tactical boardgame for the entire family in which players need to anticipate the moves of their opponents and at times also bluff a bit. Each player controls a pair of hornets swiftly flying about in flower fields collecting nectar and producing as much honey as they possibly can. The buzziest honey maker will win the game!<br/><br/> 
Identik is a funny, fast-paced, family and party game that tests each player's ability to describe, draw, &amp; evaluate wacky images.<br/><br/>In each hilarious round of Identik, one player (the Art Director) describes a unique and utterly bizarre image while the other players (the Artists) attempt to draw the image based solely on the Art Director's description.<br/><br/>Once time is up, Artists trade drawings and the ten hidden criteria for the image are uncovered. It&rsquo;s up to each Artist to decide whether the drawing he or she is judging meets the criteria and receives points.<br/><br/> 
The game is played in rounds. Each round, one of the players is chosen as the &quot;subject&quot; of a question. The question has 6 multiple choice answers. The question is read aloud and players vote on the answer they think is correct. Points are awarded to the players that chose the most popular answer.<br/><br/>An example of a question:<br/><br/>Imaginiff &lt;blank&gt; were a flying object.

Incan Gold is a quick, fun and tense game in which you and other adventurers explore an old Incan temple in search of gold and treasure.  In each of the five rounds, you secretly choose if you want to continue exploring the temple in search of more treasure or retreat to the safety of your camp with your share of the treasure that has been discovered so far.<br/><br/>Each time that an explorer braves new territory, more treasure or a danger appears.  When a second type of the same danger is turned over, all exposed treasure is buried, leaving the remaining adventurers with nothing.  Do you flee the dangerous temple with your portion of the treasure that has been uncovered so far or do you venture into the exciting temple in search of more hidden valuables?<br/><br/>After five rounds of exploration, whoever has the most treasure is the ultimate explorer and winner!<br/><br/>From the publisher:  &quot;You and your fellow adventurers travel to Peru to find a ruined Incan temple and its treasures:  turquoise, obsidian and gold.  There are also rumors of valuable Incan artifacts.  Will you chance dangers like giant spiders, mummies and fire during your search, or will you escape back to camp and safety, carrying out your loot?&quot;<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Diamant<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Risco Total (Released as an unauthorized game.

Anyone who knows a little about Reiner Knizia&rsquo;s games will know that the good Doctor loves games that deal with trying to get points in various different categories and then only score that category in which the player has the fewest. In the past, Knizia has used this mechanic to develop highly complicated games, but with Einfach Genial, he has distilled the mechanic down to its purest form.<br/><br/>The game is played on a hex board. 120 equally sized pieces, each consisting of two joined hexes, come with the game. There are symbols on each hex that make up the piece &ndash; some pieces have two identical symbols, some have two different symbols (not unlike dominoes). The goal of the game is, through clever placement, to obtain points in the different symbol colors. Points are claimed by placing a piece such that the symbols on it lie next to already-placed pieces with the same symbol.<br/><br/>The game ends when no more tiles can be placed onto the board or when a player reaches the maximum number in every color. Now each player looks to see how many points they scored in the colour they 'scored the least'. Whoever has the most points in their least-scored colour is the winner. Simple.<br/><br/>The author of the game has also come up with solitaire and team play, in which two teams of two play with each player not being able to see his partner&rsquo;s tiles.<br/><br/>[From a preview by Spielbox]<br/><br/> Other Versions: <br/><br/>     Ingenious: Travel Edition<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 
It's Einfach Genial/Ingenious in a 2-player travel version.<br/><br/>The game is played on a hex board. 57 equally sized pieces, each consisting of two joined hexes come with the game. There are symbols on each hex that makes up the piece (sometimes identical symbols). The pieces are drawn randomly in the game. Each player receives six pieces to start the game, which are placed onto a rack and visible to them alone.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is, through clever placement, to obtain points in the different symbol colours. Points are claimed by placing a piece into any open space such that the symbols on it lie next to already-placed pieces with the same symbol. So, for example, if a player places a piece with a purple circle on it such that it sits next to an unbroken line of four other purple circles already on the board, then the player scores four purple points. A newly placed symbol can lie next to at most five individual rows of symbols.<br/><br/>Each player uses a scoring track to keep track of his points &ndash; one track for each colour going from 0 to 18. If a player reaches the 18th space with any colour, then he gets to call out &ldquo;Genial!&rdquo; and take another turn.<br/><br/>At the end of their turn, players draw as many tiles out of the bag as required to bring their rack back up to six.<br/><br/>The game ends when no more tiles can be placed onto the board. Now each player looks to see how many points they scored in the colour they scored the least in. Whoever has the most points in their least-scored colour is the winner.<br/><br/>In the full game, there are 5 of each double and 6 of each pair of colors, the travel edition has 2 of each double and 3 of each pair.<br/><br/>Einfach Genial - Reiseedition is part of the Kosmos two-player series.<br/><br/> 
This game has a reputation: a bad one, but not from a playability stand point.  This pure negotiation game pits the players as Renaissance era families that are engaging in rampant nepotism.  Players are seeking positions in the other families' businesses, and to further that pursuit players offer bribes.  However, once accepting a bribe, the 'bought' player is under absolutely no obligation to honor the highest briber or any other verbal deal.  In a word, this game is vicious.<br/><br/>The new AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH edition came out in 2005.<br/><br/>The main difference between the FX Schmid and the AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH versions are that the the FX Schmid version uses five houses/buildings per player, with values of 1,2,3,5, and 10, but the AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH version uses four buildings/houses per player, with values of 1,3,6, and 10.

Players take on the role of merchants offering their wares from market stands. On a player's turn, he has five actions to choose from. Actions can be used to draw cards, play cards and activate buildup cards.<br/><br/>In order to sell wares, the merchants must first lay the wares out, since customers will only buy where all the wares they want are being offered. And since market space is at a premium, players have to think hard about which wares to offer.<br/><br/>By owning important buildup cards and properly using the assets of other village inhabitants, the merchants succeed in attracting especially many customers to their stalls, making bargain buys, and messing with their opponents' plans.<br/><br/>The first player to reach a set cash level through buying and selling of wares is the winner.<br/><br/>The game's attraction lies with the many special cards.

A tower building game.<br/><br/>Jenga is played with 54 wooden blocks; each block is 3 times as long as it is wide, and slightly smaller in height than in width. The blocks are stacked in a tower formation; each story is three blocks placed adjacent to each other along their long side, and each story is placed perpendicular to the previous (so, for example, if the blocks in the first story are pointing north-south, the second story blocks will point east-west). There are therefore 18 stories to the Jenga tower. Since stacking the blocks neatly can be tedious, a plastic loading tray is included.<br/><br/>Once the tower is built, the person who built the tower moves first. Moving in Jenga consists of taking one and only one block from any story except the completed top story of the tower at the time of the turn, and placing it on the topmost story in order to complete it. Only one hand at a time may be used to remove a block; both hands can be used, but only one hand may be on the tower at a time. Blocks may be bumped to find a loose block that will not disturb the rest of the tower. Any block that is moved out of place may be left out of place if it is determined that it will knock the tower over if it is removed. The turn ends when the next person to move touches the tower, although he or she can wait 10 seconds before moving for the previous turn to end if they believe the tower will fall in that time.<br/><br/>The game ends when the tower falls in any significant way -- in other words, any piece falls from the tower, other than the piece being knocked out to move to the top. The loser is the person who made the tower fall (i.e. whose turn it was when the tower fell); the winner is the person who moved before the loser.<br/><br/>The same game concept was published in 1984 by Fagus under the name &quot;Hoppla - eins zuviel!&quot;<br/><br/> 
In Jungle Speed, you must rely on your keen sense of observation and quick reflexes. It requires a steady hand -- which can be hard to maintain during the many fits of maniacal laughter! The wooden Totem sits in the middle of the table, waiting for the player with the fastest reflexes to snatch it up and win the game.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt a hand of cards. In order to win you must be the first player to get rid of all of your cards. Each turn, all of the players reveal one of their cards. If two cards are identical, those players must make a grab for the Totem. The faster player then gives their cards to their unfortunate adversary.<br/><br/>To add to the difficulty, certain cards are almost identical, which can trick a hapless player into grabbing the Totem by mistake -- a grave error. Other cards force all players to make a grab at once, change the method of play, or otherwise add to the difficulty.<br/><br/>'Background':<br/>The Aboulou Tribe in Eastern Trisopotamia invented Jungle Speed to determine the shares of food each member received after a successful hunt approximately 3000 years ago. The Aboulous originally used eucalyptus leaves as cards for the game. These early games usually ended in bloody fights because, unfortunately, all of the cards were identical. This simple error nearly drove the tribe to extinction. This is why Jungle Speed remained unknown by the outside world until the 20th century, when 2 clever gamethropologists, Tom &amp; Yako, replaced the leaves with the playing cards we now use today.<br/><br/>Jungle Jam, Медвед, and Prawo Dżungli are unauthorized reproductions of Jungle Speed/Arriba!<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Jungle Speed: The Extreme Expansion<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Jungle Speed Flower Power<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 
Originally published in 1997 as Arabana-Ikibiti by the designer's own publisher Bambus Spieleverlag, and reprinted by Funagain in the US, this later edition is from Kosmos and Rio Grande.<br/><br/>A simple 2 player game, players use cards to place or remove bridges from a collection of islands. If you get the majority of bridges around an island, you put one of your marker stones on it and also throw off any of your opponents bridges. That may mean they no longer have a majority of bridges on the adjacent island and so lose a marker stone.

Despite the name, Kakerlakenpoker has nothing to do with poker &ndash; except that the game is all about bluffing, but with cards showing cockroaches, rats and stink bugs instead of queens, 10s and aces.<br/><br/>The deck includes 64 cards, with eight copies of eight types of critters. To set up the game, shuffle the deck and deal the cards out to players. On a turn, a player takes one card from his hand, lays it face down on the table, slides it to a player of his choice, and declares a type of critter, e.g., &quot;Stink bug&quot;. The player receiving the card either<br/><br/>&bull; Accepts the card, says either &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;, then reveals the card. If this player is wrong in her claim, she keeps the card on the table in front of her face up; if she is right, the player who gave her the card places it face up before him.<br/><br/>&bull; Peeks at the card, then passes it face down to another player, either saying the original type of critter or saying a new type. This new player again has the choice of accepting the card or passing it, unless the card has already been seen by all other players in which case the player must take the first option.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has no cards to pass on his turn or when a player has four cards of the same critter on the table in front of him. In either case, this player loses and everyone else wins.<br/><br/> 
It's the game that combines lasers with classic strategy. Players alternate turns moving Egyptian-themed pieces having two, one or no mirrored surfaces. All four types of pieces (pharaoh, Anubis, pyramid and scarab) can either move one square forward, back, left, right, or diagonal, or stay in the same square and rotate by a quarter twist. Each turn ends by firing the real laser diode built into each player's Sphinx piece. The laser beam bounces from mirror to mirror; if the beam strikes a non-mirrored surface on any piece, it is immediately removed from play. The ultimate goal is to illuminate your opponent's pharaoh, while shielding yours from harm!<br/><br/>Re-development of<br/>Khet: The Laser Game<br/><br/>

In Kingdom Builder, the players create their own kingdoms by skillfully building their settlements, aiming to earn the most gold at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Nine different kinds of terrain are on the variable game board, including locations and castles. During his turn, a player plays his terrain card and builds three settlements on three hexes of this kind. If possible, a new settlement must be built next to one of that player&rsquo;s existing settlements. When building next to a location, the player may seize an extra action tile that he may use from his next turn on. These extra actions allow extraordinary actions such as moving your settlements.<br/><br/>By building next to a castle, the player will earn gold at the end of the game, but the most gold will be earned by meeting the conditions of the three Kingdom Builder cards; these three cards (from a total of ten in the game) specify the conditions that must be met in order to earn the much-desired gold, such as earning gold for your settlements built next to water hexes or having the majority of settlements in a sector of the board.<br/><br/>Each game, players will use a random set of Kingdom Builder cards (3 of 10), special actions (4 of 8), and terrain sectors to build the map (4 of 8), ensuring you won't play the same game twice!<br/><br/>

It is played without a board, using 18 tactile pieces that are etched and painted on both sides with different symbols.<br/><br/>The game has simple rules that are based on the visually recognizable symbols of Rock Paper Scissors.<br/><br/>Logan Stones takes the simplicity of &lsquo;Rock Paper Scissors&rsquo; and adds to it a fast paced, fun game, that can also be played with strategic precision for a much more thought provoking experience. The aim is to make a line of 4 of the same symbol, but as you and your opponent are in control of the same stones and with them constantly being flipped over to reveal new symbols, it&rsquo;s not as simple as it sounds.&quot;<br/><br/>

Lost Cities is a card game from the Kosmos two-player series. The object is to mount profitable expeditions to one or more of the five different lost cities.  Card play is quite straightforward, with a few agonizing moments sprinkled through what is mostly a fast-moving game.  If you start a given expedition, you'd better make some progress in it, or it'll score you negative points.  If you can make a lot of progress, you'll score quite well.  After three rounds, the highest total score takes the day.<br/><br/>Rules are included for a four-player team game that requires two copies to play.<br/><br/> 
From the Keltis entry:<br/><br/>Players play cards to move their playing pieces along stone paths. There are cards with 5 different colors/symbols, each corresponding to one path; in addition, each card shows a number (0-10, twice each). In each color, each player can play his cards either ascending or descending. Like Lost Cities, it's better to concentrate on a few paths, since the last spaces grants high points, but ending early gives negative ones.<br/><br/>The player in turn plays one card (out of a hand of 8), or discards one. He moves the corresponding playing piece on the path. Many of the spaces have a token that grants some bonus - either direct points (counted on the scoring track), an extra move on a path, or wish stones that are needed at game end to avoid negative points.<br/><br/>The game ends when a total of 5 playing pieces have reached the 7th space (or more) on their paths. Now, scoring happens:<br/><br/><br/>     Pieces which only moved 1-3 steps give negative points (-4, -3, -2).<br/>     Pieces with 4+ steps grant points (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10).<br/>     One piece of each player is higher and scores double.<br/>     Fewer than two wish stones grants negative points (-3 / -4)<br/>     5+ wish stones yield a bonus of 10 points.<br/>     All this is added to the points scored during the game<br/><br/><br/>Primary differences between Lost Cities: The Board Game and Keltis:<br/><br/>1. In LCBG you play 3 rounds, scoring at the end of all 3 for the monuments you collect. (Normal scoring occurs each round.) In Keltis, you only play 1 round, and score everything each round. This is not just a rule difference, as the scoring is different for the monuments/stones based on the number collected.<br/><br/>2. In Keltis, you may play your cards in either order, descending, high to low, or ascending, low to high. In LCBG, you must play in ascending order.<br/><br/>Note: the rules for LCBG have the Keltis rules as variants, and have the board elements necessary for #1 above. Keltis does not have the rules nor board elements to play LCBG.<br/><br/><br/>     Kosmos (Keltis publisher) changed the card play to ascending and descending order to target casual gamers.<br/>     Kosmos change the theme to fit in with other Kosmos abstract game series. <br/><br/><br/>There are more differences, which are non-substantive. (Art, points in LCBG multiplied by 5, etc.)<br/>     <br/>Reiner Knizia:  &quot;The original version that we developed is exactly what Jay [Tummelson, owner of Rio Grande Games] has now published,&quot;<br/><br/> 
Louis XIV, by R&uuml;diger Dorn, is about power and influence in the French court at the end of the 17th Century.<br/><br/>The players take on the roles of members of the Court, where they carry out their missions and goals at Versailles. By using cards and influence markers, they influence high-ranking Court attendants, such as the King's Mother or one of the countless Royal mistresses. Naturally, the Sun King himself has a special role here too.<br/><br/>An excellent time and a high level of tension are guaranteed. The final outcome is in doubt right up to the end. Each game is different. A change of pace but still a highly promising strategy game in the finest Alea tradition, one that sits at level 5 on the Alea complexity scale.<br/><br/>

Looping and turns - dive and roll. Each player is an aerobatics pilot who does their daring stunts in front of an enthusiastic audience. Play cards to set up the difficulty level and roll dice to succeed. The more dangerous a stunt is - the more more points it gives, but it is of course harder to roll on the dice.<br/><br/> 
Very similar to Out of Context or any of the other find-the-real-answer games.  A question card is selected by the reader (e.g. &quot;Why does Mickey Mouse have 4 fingers&quot;).  On the back is the correct answer.  That correct card is placed into a wallet and closed.  Into all other wallets (identical) a bluff card has been placed.  The wallets are shuffled and passed around the table.  Then everyone reads their card.  If they have the correct answer, they must read it.  If they have a &quot;bluff,&quot; they make up an answer.  &quot;Balderdash&quot; voting ensues.<br/><br/> 
Each player takes the role of a salesperson who tries to outwit the others. In turn each player rolls the dice and then moves Assam, the market organizer. If Assam stops on an opponent&rsquo;s rug, the player must make a payment to its owner before putting one of their own rugs on an adjacent space.

Merkator is about the rise of Hamburg after the Thirty Years' War.<br/><br/>You visit cities to collect goods or fulfill orders. The collected goods are added to the cities when a player visits a neighboring city. Fulfilling an order provides you with another better, but more complex order additional to the fulfilled order which you keep and can fulfill again, although the number of orders you can own is limited. Each order itself is worth a certain amount of points at the end of the game. Also you can exchange these points for special cards which provide additional goods in certain cities or more victory points if you fulfill certain conditions at game end.<br/><br/>Depending on the city you want to enter you either receive a resource called &quot;time&quot; or you have to spend it. By paying a certain time-fee you are allowed to accompany another player on his trip to a town to fulfill your orders in this town (but not to collect goods). The game ends when a player receives the order with the highest value by fulfilling the order one level below.<br/><br/>

This is an updated version of X-Bugs, by the same designers, released by Nexus and distibuted by Fantasy Flight Games in the USA.  Redesigned from the ground up, the core game mechanic remains the same, but all armies have been tweaked and modified along a structure that makes use of cards describing abilities and upgrades, cardboard bases and resources, measuring rulers for some special abilities, and large cardboard tiles representing special terrain.  The game now also includes a playmat.<br/><br/>The game is based on the classic Tiddlywinks.  The set includes four armies, each with three bases and a distinct assortment of bugs.  The bugs are plastic winks in three different shapes and sizes.  Two six-sided dice determine which bugs you may move on a turn.  Enemy bugs and bases are defeated by landing your bugs on top of them.  All bugs also feature special abilities, such as allowing multiple moves or firing projectile winks.<br/><br/> 
One Thousand Milestones. On French roads there are small marker stones giving the distance in kilometres to the next town. In this famous old French card game, players compete to drive 1000 km, dealing with hazards along the way. Draw a card to your hand, play or discard. You must lay a green traffic light to start, play cards showing mileage, dump hazards (flat tire, speed limit) on the other players, remedy hazards (spare tire, end of limit) from yourself, play safety cards (puncture proof), and try to be the first to clock up the distance.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Touring<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Grass<br/>    Pain Doctors<br/>    Race Cards (Darrell Waltrip Presents Race Cards, The Stock Car Racing Game)<br/>    Online: Internet Card Game<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     CCG Workshop (no longer available)<br/><br/><br/> 
The classic real estate game. Buy properties, build houses and hotels, collect rent from fellow players. Repeat as necessary until everyone else is bankrupt.<br/><br/>Monopoly was patented in 1935 by Charles Darrow and released by Parker Brothers. The game was actually one of a number of variants in existence at the time, all of which date back to an earlier, 1904 game by Elizabeth J. Magie, called The Landlord's Game. Magie was a proponent of the Single Tax put forth by famous author Henry George.  The game was designed to show how the Single Tax would work - players could choose to play under regular rules or alternate &quot;Single Tax&quot; rules.<br/><br/>The game didn't really go anywhere and Magie lost interest in it. Variations of the game evolved, however, and homemade versions traveled up and down the Atlantic coast and even as far west as Michigan and Texas, being developed all along the way. Eventually the game was noticed by Charles Darrow who introduced it to the world in its current form.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    The Landlord's Game<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/>Official<br/><br/>    Monopoly Stock Exchange Add-on<br/>    Monopoly Free Parking Mini Game<br/>    Monopoly Get Out of Jail Mini Game<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Unofficial<br/><br/>    Super Add-ons: Monopoly<br/>    Entrepreneur's Accessory to Monopoly<br/>    Game Spice: Monopoly Expansion<br/>    Mafiopoly<br/>    Monopoly: Mob Rule Expansion Deck<br/>    Final Fantasy Monopoly<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

Monopoly: The Mega Edition is bigger and believe it or not, faster than regular Monopoly. What makes it bigger is a larger board, Train Depots, Skyscrapers, 9 new Properties, and the addition of the $1,000 bill. It is faster because of a new speed die and Bus cards. Monopoly: The Mega Edition can be played in 1&frac12; hours with more fun than ever!<br/><br/>The massive game board has 12 additional spaces, including 9 new properties. You'll be able to buy, for the first time: California, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Arctic Avenues, plus the Gas Company. Each joins an existing group.<br/><br/>Buy all the properties of a group, build your houses and hotels, and then keep on going by building Skyscrapers for a chance to earn &quot;mega&quot; rents. Good news: you can build houses and hotels once you own three out of four properties in a group (or two out of three in the smaller groups). You can even build a Depot on a railroad to double its rent.<br/><br/>Start play with $2500, including a $1,000 bill.<br/><br/>Roll three dice on your turn: two regular dice and the special &quot;Speed&quot; Die. The Speed Die gives you a chance for free trip to the next unowned property. (Later in the game the Speed Die could send you to the next property you owe rent on. Ouch!) From time to time you'll earn free &quot;Bus Tickets.&quot; Use them to go where you want to go, but beware: they expire! The Speed Die and the Bus Tickets make the action speedy, intense, and sure-fire fun!<br/><br/>

One of the two players represents Jack the Ripper, who will be one of the 8 characters on the board. This player knows the identity of this character and his goal is to flee from the district as soon as possible (or avoid being accused for eight turns). The other player represents an independent investigator (not represented on the board) who tries to guess the identity of Jack. But he can make only one accusation during the game!<br/><br/>During each turn the players move the characters, using their special powers, placing them either in shadow or light.  At the end of each turn, the witnesses declare if Jack is visible (in light, or adjacent to another character) or not (alone in the shadows).  This allows the investigator to know which characters are innocent.  This continues as the investigator tries to eliminate suspects while Jack tries to escape.  Intuition, logic and cold blood will be necessary for each of the two participants.<br/><br/>Check out the awesome graphics by our own BGGer/genius graphic designer Piero Lalune ( pierolalune)<br/><br/>Mr. Jack is exclusively published by Hurrican, all printings of Mr. Jack are from Hurrican and distributed by other companies<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Mr. Jack: The Carriage<br/>    Mr. Jack Extension<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>New Stand-Alone Version<br/><br/>    Mr. Jack in New York Same basic structure, eight NEW characters! <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

Tumblety, a quack doctor, is arrested and freed on bail. He immediately flees to the United States.<br/><br/>New York - Manhattan Island - January 1889<br/><br/>Alerted by London, the New York police are on the lookout for Tumblety. Certain witnesses confirm his presence in Manhattan and crimes are committed with a modus operandi similar to those in London.<br/><br/>The police call upon some of the city&rsquo;s most eminent citizens to help them with their investigation.<br/><br/>Is Tumblety really Jack?<br/><br/>If not, who is he pretending to be? These are the stakes in &quot;Mr Jack in New York&quot;.<br/><br/>Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>Suspected of being the terrible Ripper, Francis J. Tumblety, the self-proclaimed doctor, is arrested by the London police service. He then escapes to New-York, where witnesses see him. The local police will not be deceived, as rumors suggest that he is in Manhattan, where the crimes appear strangely like they did in London. The police take no chance and ask the most eminent people of the city to help them in the chase of The Ripper.  You will need to Investigate whether Francis J. Tumblety the real Mr. Jack, or if it is someone else.<br/> Mr. Jack in New-York is a complete game all on its own, however it is recommend for a beginner to play Mr. Jack first.

From Bruno Faidutti's site:<br/><br/>It has been found again by Bruno Cathala and Ludovic Maublanc with Mr.Jack Pocket, the small card game derived from Mr. Jack. The board is replaced by a square grid made of nine street cards. The suspects, and among them Mr.Jack, are pictured on the cards. Holmes, Watson and a dog are turning around the grid, a system already used by Bruno Cathala in several games, and can &ldquo;look&rdquo; at the streets in a row or column. Every round, like in Mr.Jack, four actions are available. The first player selects one, his opponent two, and the first player then uses the last remaining action. Actions allow moving a detective one or two spaces clockwise around the grid, turning a card in order to change the view of the streets, swapping two street cards or drawing an alibi card. At the end of the round, Mr.Jack states if he can be seen by one of the detectives. Of course, the detectives must identify Jack, who must stay hidden long enough to escape.<br/><br/>

Days of Wonder announces Mystery Express<br/><br/>Whodunit on Rails re-invents the classic deduction-style board game<br/>Los Altos, CA; Paris, France - January 25, 2010. Days of Wonder announces Mystery Express, an imaginative new take on the classic deduction game from Antoine Bauza &amp; Serge Laget. While Days of Wonder's first &quot;whodunit&quot; game, 2003's Mystery of the Abbey, was considerably more quirky and chaotic, Mystery Express explores the more analytical side of the genre, rewarding a logical and more precise approach to solving the crime.<br/><br/>Players board the famous Orient Express in Paris just as a murder occurs. The rest of the trip - through Strasbourg, Munich, Vienna, Budapest and their final destination of Istanbul - is consumed with determining the who, what, when, where and why of the crime. Players use their special powers of deduction; information gleaned from others in various train cars; and investigative actions to determine the exact circumstances of the murder. The one who correctly identifies the most elements of the crime by the time the train reaches Istanbul wins the game.<br/><br/>Mystery Express is a classic Days of Wonder design made up of top-notch components and unique, period-perfect illustrations. Along with the Mystery Express board map detailing its itinerary from Paris to Istanbul the game features: 5 resin character figures and matching character tokens; 5 Ticket wallets that include a description of each character's special power; 100 Deduction sheets that players use to keep track of their deductions; 72 Crime cards; a Mystery Express miniature train to track the Mystery Express's journey on the map; a Conductor figure; 2 small passenger tokens, a miniature travel bag, a train whistle and rules booklet. Mystery Express is for 3-5 players and will be available worldwide in April 2010. Price is $50/&euro;45.<br/><br/>Video Overview from Myriad Games Presentations available here<br/><br/> 
Niagara is set in the not particularly safe world of rushing waterfalls. In the late 18th Century, the Shawnee and Iroquois Indians pointed white Desperadoes, Mercenaries and Adventurers in the direction of hidden caches of valuable jewels, in the hopes of turning them against one another and away from their territorial expansion ambitions. Players play as some of those Adventurers.<br/><br/>The first player to be able to claim ownership of five jewels is the winner. But the chase after the riches has some snags. The speed of the river is always changing, since the speed depends on the decisions of the players and the changeable weather. And once a canoe goes over the walls, it's a hefty investment to replace it. And there are also the Desperadoes to contend with, who aren't above trying to plunder the riches from Adventurers returning home. Niagara is distinguished by an innovative movement mechanic as well as a beautiful three-dimensional rendering of the waterfall setting.<br/><br/> Expanded by: <br/><br/><br/>     Niagara: Diamond Joe<br/>     The Spirits of Niagara<br/><br/><br/> 
Philippe Keyaerts scored gold with Small World, a new version of his Vinci that was released by Days of Wonder in 2009 to great acclaim and numerous awards. With Olympos, coming from French publisher Ystari Games, Keyaerts has another go at the simplified civilization game. The playing time for Olympos is only 60-90 minutes for 3-5 players, but says Ystari's Cyril Demaegd, &quot;Even if it's a short game, it's a gamer's game.&quot;<br/><br/>Players take actions based on their position on a time track, along the lines of Peter Prinz' Thebes. (Says Demaegd, &quot;This is mainly a coincidence because Philippe designed this game years ago.&quot;) By spending time, players take actions, with the choices being expansion or development. Expanding brings new settlers onto the game board, which depicts Greece and Atlantis, which lets you conquer territories and thereby acquire resources.<br/><br/>Development takes place on the game's discovery board, with players either buying new scientific discoveries &ndash; such as medicine or phalanxes &ndash; or building architectural wonders. Each discovery brings you new powers, such as an upgrade in military strength due to the phalanx, and each wonder earns you points.<br/><br/>A player's piety is measured by discoveries, and the most pious player might be rewarded during the game by one of the nine gods included. Similarly, the less pious players might be punished by those same gods.<br/><br/>The replayability of Olympos is huge, says Demaegd, as the discovery board and gods in play will be different each game, not to mention the territories you're able to conquer.<br/><br/> 
 Operation is a dexterity game in which you must extract silly body parts from a hapless patient.  In the course of the game you acquire cards which dictate that you must remove a certain piece from the body of the patient.  To do this you use a set of tweezers that are attached by wire to the game board.  If you are sloppy and touch the metal sides of the hole where the item is located, the patient's pain is indicated by a sudden buzzer and light-up nose.  Successful extractions net cash, and the player with the most cash at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>Various editions change the patient and the items to be removed, but the game stays the same in its essence:<br/><br/>     Shrek -- just like the classic version, but with Shrek.<br/>     Simpsons -- Remove Homer's Bowler's Thumb, Pot Belly, Foot in Mouth, Rubber Neck, Trick Knee, etc.<br/>     T-Rex -- excavating bones of a T. Rex<br/>     Spiderman 3 -- healing all of Spiderman's ailments<br/>     Pit Stop -- manipulating various car parts instead of people-parts<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>     Operation: Rapid Response<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 
In Pack &amp; Stack the players try to fill their trucks as perfectly as possible.<br/><br/>Players start each round with a random selection of different-sized goods, determine by the roll of several dice. Then each player takes one or two trucks from the supply face-down (numbers depend on the number of players) The trucks are revealed simultaneously and each player tries to make a quick assessment to get the truck that is most useful for his or her supply of goods.  Players stack the goods in the space of their selected truck defined by the boundaries on the truck-bed and the height restriction noted on the truck. Players get negative scores if the truck they picked was too large (a lot of unused space at 1 point per unused space) or too small (a lot of goods don't fit at 2 points per space of goods that would not fit).  The player who gets the lowest negative score in a round gains 10 points.  Players &quot;pay&quot; points  for their negative values, and rounds continue until at least one player no longer has any points; the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/> 
You are specialists at the CDC/Atlanta where you watch several virulent diseases break out simultaneously all over the world. The team mission is to prevent a worldwide pandemic outbreak, treating hot spots while researching cures for each of the four plagues before they get out of hand.<br/><br/>Players must plan their strategy to mesh their specialists' strengths before the diseases overwhelm the world. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases. The Scientist needs only 4 cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal 5. But the diseases are breaking out fast and time is running out: the team must try to stem the tide of infection in diseased areas while developing cures. If disease spreads uncontrolled, the players all lose. If they can cure all four diseases, they win.<br/><br/>The board shows earth with some big population centres. On each turn a player can use four actions to travel, cure, discover and build. Cards are used for this but the deck also contains Epidemics...<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/><br/>     Pandemic: On the Brink<br/>     Pandemic: mini expansion "De Generalist"<br/><br/><br/> 
This expansion to Pandemic includes new event cards, new role cards, rules for five players, and optional game challenges to increase the difficulty, such as the 'Legendary' difficulty level, the Virulent Strain challenge, the Mutation challenge, and the Bio-Terrorist challenge. These challenges can be mixed together to make the game even harder.<br/><br/>Virulent Strain challenge: makes one disease become particularly deadly in unpredictable ways.<br/><br/>Mutation Challenge: adds a fifth (purple) disease that behaves differently than the original four.<br/><br/>Bio-Terrorist Challenge: pits one player against the others!<br/><br/>You may also play with 5 players and play on Legendary level!<br/><br/>Other components include petri dishes to store your diseases and pawns.<br/><br/>On the Brink version differences:<br/><br/>     116 cards from the base game (with some corrections)<br/>     only 7 pawns (small-size)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>On the Brink requires a copy of Pandemic to play; it is not a stand-alone game.<br/><br/> 
Panic Station is a paranoia-driven partly cooperative game in which you control two characters in the Extermination Corps sent out by the government to investigate the presence of fiendish alien life forms.<br/><br/>Players need to move both their Androids and Troopers through the base, exploring and gathering equipment that will help them to complete their mission: to find and destroy the Parasite Hive hidden somewhere in the inner depths of this hell. When a player manages to get his Trooper into the Hive location and play three gas can cards to fuel his Flamethrower, he wins the game for the humans.<br/><br/>However, one of the players is a Host. He must keep this identity secret, infecting as many team members as possible to gain allies and prevent the humans from completing their mission. Only players who carefully watch the behavior of team members and find a good balance between cooperation and paranoia will stand a chance against the infected players and roaming parasites.<br/><br/>The game uses a unique exponential traitor-system and combines tactical play with a compelling psychological mindgame amongst players.<br/><br/>Panic Station is a game of growing paranoia in which no one can truly trust anyone. Can you maintain your sanity and destroy the source of this evil?<br/><br/>

Players make successively higher declarations regarding the results of all the dice remaining in the game, e.g. &quot;there are ten sixes&quot;. However, someone can always contest the bid. When that happens, all the dice are revealed and either the bidder or the caller loses dice, depending on who was correct. The last player with dice is the winner.<br/><br/>There is also a public domain dice game known as Liar's Dice.  This game is often played with Poker Dice, and differs from the marketed versions in that players only declare on their own hand's value (as opposed to all dice being in play), using poker-hand values. A version of this game with only one cup that gets passed around is what's usually referred to by the name &quot;pokert&auml;rning&quot; (&quot;poker dice&quot;) in Sweden.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Bid It<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 
There used to be friendly competition among co-workers at the Apple Factory during Bonus Week, as workers made a special effort to Pick &amp; Pack those crates with quality apples.<br/><br/>But this year the mechanical arm has broken down...<br/><br/>Now it takes two people to get it to work. One set of controls operates left and right, the other set operates up and down. Now you are competing directly with your partner to get the most apples. Can you grab the premium apples while leaving your partner with wholesale fodder? Can you exploit a rush order, or throw a wrench in the works? Quality control and order mix-ups also add to the fun.<br/><br/>In the end, the player with the most apples in their crates wins.<br/><br/> 
 
From the box:<br/>It's fast, it's fun, and it's always challenging! Each player draws letter tiles, building their own personal crossword as fast as they can. Whenever players use all their letters they call out &quot;pick two!&quot; and everyone, including that player, draws two more tiles. The Catch? These tiles must now be added to your crossword. The Best Part? You can always change your crossword by rearranging letters and even words to use up your tiles. When the center pile of tiles is gone, the first one done...wins!<br/><br/> 
Playing Pictionary may remind you of Charades, but with drawing on paper instead of acting out the answers.  In Pictionary, though, both teams' (or even all three teams') clue givers may be drawing at the same time as players strive to be the first to guess the correct answer.  When the answer is not designated &quot;All Play,&quot; one team simply tries to come up with the answer before the timer runs out, which is usually but not always possible thanks to the varying difficulty levels of the answers.  No great drawing talent is required; instead, players gain an edge if they have a good imagination when guessing, empathy for their team mates, and/or a general ability to communicate in restricted circumstances.  A board is provided, just to keep score on, which focuses the competition.  Pictionary was a big hit when it first appeared and has been a classic on the party game scene ever since.<br/><br/>Microbadges:   (Buy One)<br/><br/> 
From the designer &amp; publisher:<br/><br/>Pictureka! is a new kind of game, both in mechanic as in artwork. The mechanic is invigorating with its large square gaming tiles. The game board is composed of 3 by 3 game tiles, so the game board on which is played is a huge square of 63 cm x 63 cm. This is large enough for several players to be able to play the game at the same time. The game board is &ldquo;alive&rdquo;, it is not a static board as the tiles are flipped over, turned and moved. So it is not possible to memory map the board. The mechanic of an ever changing board makes it not only fun; also the challenge is kept into the game all the time.<br/><br/>A game turn <br/>Players will have to throw a color dice at the beginning of their turn. According to the color thrown (3 possibilities) they must draw a mission card of the same color. There are 3 kinds of missions.<br/><br/>How to win the game? <br/>Be the first one to have successfully accomplished 10 missions. Each successful mission gives 1 point, so be the first one to get 10 points. <br/>The artwork is something not to be found in &lsquo;standard&rsquo; games. The personal drawing style of the artist Eugene makes this a kind of playing artwork.<br/><br/> 
The original game was invented by Harry E. Gavitt and published in 1903 by Gavitt Publishing and Printing.  In that game players deal and trade cards to corner the railway stock market. Be the first to get all the cards of one railway line, call out &ldquo;Topeka&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll win the hand!<br/><br/>But Pit, the more famous version, adapted by noted psychic Edgar Cayce, was first published by Parker Brothers in 1904 and in many editions since. In this loud, real-time trading game, players are given the task of cornering the market in one type of commodity.  There are as many suits as there are players, and all the cards are dealt out at the start of each round.  When the trading begins, players offer sets of cards to each other in the hopes of completing a set for themselves.  If you're successful, you ring the (optional)bell and yell out, &quot;Corner on wheat!&quot; (or whatever your commodity is). You then score points depending on which it was - some are more valuable than others.

Power Grid is the updated release of the Friedemann Friese crayon game Funkenschlag. It removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original edition, while retaining the fluctuating commodities market like Crude: The Oil Game and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.<br/><br/>The object of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size.  In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.<br/><br/>However, as plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.<br/><br/>Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>    <br/>         Power Grid FAQ<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Power Grid FAQ - Please read this before posting a rules question!

Players attract artists and scholars trying to become the most prestigious family in Florence. Each player is given a palace grid and reference chart and attempts to gain the most victory points after seven rounds. Scoring victory points can be done in a variety of ways although most will be earned by playing profession cards to generate work points. There are a variety of professions such as astronomers, organists and architects. Each is attracted to a particular combination of building, landscape feature, and social freedom. The more the player can match these preferences then the more work points are generated. If a player satisfies the minimum requirement of work points, which increases each round, then the work can be created and the player can then trade the work points for cash and/or victory points.<br/><br/> 
In Prolix, players score points by coming up with words whose letters match those of the Letter Chips on the board. Unlike other word games, you don&rsquo;t need all the letters of a word to be on the board to use that word.<br/><br/>This means that you are free to use all those words you always wanted to use in other word games, but were always a few tiles or cards short!<br/><br/>Of course, the letters in your word won&rsquo;t score if they aren&rsquo;t on the board, so even huge words can be stinkers if you don&rsquo;t use them at the right time.<br/><br/>Letters score based on how rare they are, and where they are on the board. Once you finish scoring your letters, all letter chips move across the board, changing their value.<br/><br/>If you have a great word but it&rsquo;s not your turn, you&rsquo;re allowed to interrupt another player&rsquo;s turn and score. But be careful, because you can lose points by interrupting with low-scoring words. And of course, other players can interrupt your turn if they wish, or even force you to say a word by flipping a timer.<br/><br/> Microbadges <br/><br/>Buy Microbadge - Prolix Fan<br/><br/><br/>Letter distribution: all consonants occur five times, with the exception of four letters that occur twice (K,V,W,Y), and four letters that occur just once (J,Q,X,Z).<br/><br/> 
The BoardGameGeek glossary helpfully includes the term &quot;fart-factor&quot; for those who have wondered how to describe the gassy sound created when pushing down on a box lid. Who knew that someday a couple of game designers would move the farts from inside the box to the front cover?<br/><br/>Yes, PRRRT... &ndash; from the designing duo of Ludovic Maublanc and Bruno Cathala &ndash; is all about the rip-roarers and pants-busters that emerge from one's nether regions, more specifically about determining who dealt it (while thankfully avoiding the &quot;who smelt it&quot; end of the equation).<br/><br/>Each round a situation card is revealed, such as a small crowd in an elevator, and a number of people cards equal to the crowd depicted on the card are turned face up. People cards are valued from 1 to 10 based on the amount of shame that person would have towards you should you be revealed as the culprit. Grannies are merciless...<br/><br/>Each player receives a hand of five odor cards, ranging in value from 0 to 7, with one 7, two 6s and so on to eight 0s. Going once around the table, each player in turn asks his neighbor, &quot;So how about it? Are you the one contributing to climate change? Are you the one making more methane?&quot; And so on. That neighbor can either fess up &ndash; in which case he scores all the people cards in play &ndash; or he can deny the charge, in which case the active player randomly draws a card from his hand and lays it on the table in front of the neighbor, revealing some of the smell that others have detected.<br/><br/>If you make it once around the table without anyone confessing, add another person card to the crowd of sniffers, then go around the table again. Repeat this process up to three times, at which point most people will have three cards in front of them. Everyone then simultaneously points to the person who they think created the ruckus (that is, who has the largest total of odor cards), abstaining if they are that person. Everyone then sums their stink, with the &quot;winner&quot; claiming the person cards in play and a card for each person blaming him; anyone who accuses a player incorrectly is penalized. Smallest score after a number of rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>Being dealt a hand of high numbers doesn't automatically presage your coronation as a gas god as high numbers typically have a special power that comes into play when someone reveals the card from your hand. The 7, for example, removes all other cards in your hand from play, while the 6 lets you exchange up to three cards from your hand with an opponent. With odor comes power!<br/><br/> 
The players are plantation owners in Puerto Rico in the days when ships had sails. Growing up to five different kind of crops&mdash;corn, indigo, sugar, tobacco, and coffee&mdash;they must try to run their business more efficiently than their close competitors: growing crops and storing them efficiently, developing San Juan with useful buildings, deploying their colonists to best effect, selling crops at the right time, and, most importantly, shipping their goods back to Europe for maximum benefit.<br/><br/>The game system lets players choose the order of the phases in each turn by allowing each player to choose a role from those remaining when it is their turn. No role can be selected twice in the same round.

Puzzle Strike is a complete game in a box that has the fun of a customizable card game without the marketing scheme of selling you parts of the game in random packs. You build your deck *as* you play the game. Every game is different because the bank starts with a different set of chips each game. Also, there are 10 characters to choose from, each with different gameplay. Between all that, there are over 411 MILLION starting conditions in a 4-player game.<br/><br/>A built-in comeback mechanic means that when you're on the edge of losing, you're also able to do even more combos than usual.<br/><br/>Shuffling cards takes too long and is boring, so in Puzzle Strike you just put your cardboard tokens in a bag and shake them up to shuffle! Plus, it&rsquo;s pretty ballin&rsquo; to play a game with chips. Play it on your yacht, impress potential mates, etc.<br/><br/>Though the game is fun even if you're terrible at it, it's also balanced for high level play by veteran asymmetric game balancer David Sirlin (Street Fighter HD Remix, Puzzle Fighter HD Remix, Kongai, Yomi, and Flash Duel.)<br/><br/>Puzzle Strike contains:<br/><br/>    Almost 350 cardboard chips<br/>    4 cloth bags<br/>    8-page full color rulebook<br/>    Colorful box with inside designed to separate the chips by type, for storage<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Online play: <a target='_blank' href="http://www.fantasystrike.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.fantasystrike.com</a><br/><br/> 
A simple design, but a good strategy game. Be the player that places the final ball at the top of the pyramid.  Sounds simple enough, right?<br/><br/>Like in Go, 2 players square off with their colored pieces, in this case dark or light balls. The board has 16 hollows that allow a pyramid to be built.  The goal is to be the one at the top.<br/><br/>The strategy comes in even as the first few pieces are placed on the board; if you can get a &quot;square&quot; formed (4 balls of your color adjacent to each other on the same level), you can remove any 1 or 2 of your pieces (that don't support other pieces) and put them back in your reserve.<br/><br/>Even if a square formed is not all one color, a piece-saving move is available called &quot;stacking.&quot;  Anywhere a square is formed, a player can move a piece up a level, onto the square.  This can effectively lock some pieces down, at least for a little while.  It also allows the player to make a play without using a piece from their reserve.<br/><br/>Although the rules are only 1 side of a sheet of paper, they do include a couple of variants.  One is for children (no square bonus), the other is for experts (1 or 2 pieces removed if you form a &quot;line&quot; in your color). The rules state that the game duration is normally between 5 and 20 minutes.<br/><br/>Pylos evolved from the designer's earlier game Strat-o-sphere.<br/><br/>Components<br/><br/>     1 Pyramid Board <br/>     30 Wooden Balls <br/>     Rules <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>1994 Mensa Select<br/><br/> 
Players take on the roles of Quarriors - mighty mystical warriors who have the power to capture dangerous quarry from the untamed Wilds! They must conjure the mysterious powers of Quiddity, cast powerful spells, and summon their creatures to battle if they hope to overcome rivals and earn their rightful place as the Champion!<br/><br/>Quarriors has the frenetic excitement of a dice battle game, with an added &lsquo;deckbuilding&rsquo; twist: players customize their dice pools during the game using resources generated by their rolls.<br/><br/>Quarriors takes the best of deckbuilding games without the tedium of shuffling.  Take a typical deckbuilding game, add the speed and fun of dice and in 60 minutes you&rsquo;re on your second or third game trying unique strategies against your opponents.<br/><br/>Alternate Description of Quarriors<br/><br/>In Quarriors, each player plays as a Quarrior competing for Glory in the eyes of Quiana, the Empress of Quaridia. Each player starts with an identical set of 12 dice in their dice bag. At the start of the game, Creature and Spell dice (Quarry) are dealt at random to form &quot;the Wilds&quot; in the center of the table. As play progresses, players roll their dice to attempt to summon Creatures, cast Spells, and harness the magical power of Quiddity (the in-game resource) to capture Quarry from the Wilds to add to their repertoire and into their dice bag. Players draw and roll 6 dice a turn from their bag, making that controlling bag composition is key to victory.<br/><br/>Quarriors is a fast-paced game where players must strategically balance their choices each turn. Do I use my Quiddity to summon Creatures in the hopes of scoring Glory or should I spend it all to capture more powerful Quarry from the Wilds? Players must outmaneuver their opponent's through strategic Spell use, the acquisition of powerful Quarry, and ultimately, by striking down opponent's Creature in combat. If your Creatures survive until your next turn, you will score Glory points and move closer to victory!<br/><br/>

Quarto! has a 4x4 board and 16 pieces. Each piece has four dichotomous attributes: color, height, shape and consistency. So each piece is either black or white, tall or short, square or round, and hollow or solid. The object is to place the fourth piece in a row where all four pieces have at least one attribute in common. The twist is your opponent gets to choose the piece you place on the board every turn.<br/><br/> 
Qu&eacute;bec puts you at the head of a rich family who wants to leave its name in history by building Qu&eacute;bec city. The game spans four centuries during which you erect the most prestigious buildings and places of the city. Construction is not enough: you also have to ensure your presence in the great spheres of power. It is up to you and your opponents to build Qu&eacute;bec City in your colors!<br/><br/>A game takes place over four centuries. Each player plays on average 5 to 7 turns per century. On each turn, players choose one of these actions :<br/><br/>     Start a new building with his architect<br/>     Complete part of a building<br/>     Send a worker to a zone of influence<br/>     Take a leader card<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>By contributing to the numerous buildings, players acquire influence with the authorities of the time : religion, politics, commerce and culture. Players also help build the famous Citadelle.<br/><br/>At the end of each century, there is a scoring round where players get victory points for the workers they managed to send in the 5 zones of influence. Qu&eacute;bec introduces a unique and addictive majority rule. The player with the majority in a zone cascades half of his workers by moving them to the next zone. Workers moved in this way allow a player to score even more points. If a player still has the majority in the next zone, his workers cascade again &ndash; a potentially devastating ripple effect. This mechanism illustrates the interrelationship between the great zones of influence. Players must not only fight to get majorities, they must also erect the most prestigious buildings.<br/><br/>The game ends after the fourth century. Players then receive points for the buildings they completed. The player with the most points is declared the winner.<br/><br/>Qu&eacute;bec won the Plateau d'or 2007 and was shortlisted at the 2007 Boulogne-Billancourt International Designer Contest.<br/><br/>

This abstract strategy is surprisingly deep for its simple rules.  The object of the game is to advance your pawn to the opposite edge of the board.  On your turn you may either move your pawn or place a wall.  You may hinder your opponent with wall placement, but not completely block him off.  Meanwhile, he is trying to do the same to you.  First pawn to reach the opposite side wins.<br/><br/>Re-Implements:<br/><br/>    Pinko Pallino<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Quoridor Kid<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Play online at:<br/><br/>    <a target='_blank' href="http://www.quoridor.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.quoridor.net</a><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 
While Qwirkle is as simple as matching colors and shapes, it is a game that also requires tactical maneuvers and well-planned strategy. The game consists of 108 wooden blocks with six different shapes in six colors. Using the blocks, players attempt to score the most points by building lines that share a common attribute - either color or shape. Qwirkle is a quick game to learn, but you'll soon discover that you'll need to think strategically in order to score the most points.<br/><br/>Related: Qwirkle Cubes (2009)<br/><br/> 
Ra is an auction and set-collection game with an Ancient Egyptian theme.  Each turn players are able to purchase lots of tiles with their bidding tiles.  Once a player has used up his or her Suns, the other players continue until they do likewise, which may set up a situation with a single uncontested player bidding on tiles before the end of the round occurs.  Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch.  The tiles give either immediate points, prevent negative points for not having certain types at the end of the round (epoch), or give points after the final round.  The game lasts for three &quot;epochs&quot; (rounds).  The game offers a short learning curve, and experienced players find it both fast-moving and a quick play.<br/><br/>From the Box:<br/>The game spans 1500 years of Egyptian history in less than an hour!<br/>The players seek to expand their power and fame and there are many ways to accomplish this: Influencing Pharaohs, Building monuments, Farming on the Nile, Paying homage to the Gods, Advancing the technology and culture of the people. Ra is an auction and set collecting game where players may choose to take risks for great rewards or... And all this is for the glory of the Sun God Ra!<br/><br/> 
In the card game Race for the Galaxy, players build galactic civilizations by playing game cards in front of them that represent worlds or technical and social developments. Some worlds allow players to produce goods, which can be consumed later to gain either card draws or victory points when the appropriate technologies are available to them. These are mainly provided by the developments and worlds that are not able to produce, but the fancier production worlds also give these bonuses.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each round, players each select, secretly and simultaneously, one of the seven roles which correspond to the phases in which the round progresses. By selecting a role, players activate that phase for this round, giving each player the opportunity to perform that phase's action. For example, if one player choses the settle role, each player has the opportunity to settle one of the planets from their hand. The player who has chosen the role, however, gets a bonus that applies only to him. But bonuses may also be acquired through developments, so one must be aware when another player also takes advantage of his choice of role.<br/><br/>

In Resident Evil, a deadly virus has caused the dead to rise and infect any living thing they encounter!  Fleeing to a mysterious mansion, you must gather any materials you can find to protect yourself and fight for your survival against a legion of infected beings!<br/><br/>The Resident Evil DBG brings the story to life in a game of strategy where players construct their card decks while they play.  Choose one of your favorite characters from Resident Evil such as: Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, or Albert Wesker among others. Players start with only the most basic of items and weapons. As the game progresses, players build their arsenal with additional Weapons, Ammunition, Action or Item cards to customize their deck and improve their ability in defeating the Infected!  Your deck will be your lifeline to survival.  How will you survive the zombie outbreak?<br/><br/>The Resident Evil DBG will consist of 250 playing cards, 3 different game modes (Story, Mercenary and Versus) and hundreds of possible scenarios within each mode for unlimited replay value.  No two games will ever be the same!<br/><br/><br/>    Story mode is the main version of the game where players must race to claim the best weapons, items, and ammunition before others get to it first. Quick thinking and a good instinct will help you survive the Mansion and be the one to escape to safety.  <br/>    Mercenary mode is similar to Story mode but this mode rewards the players that take the offensive. Players must prove their skills by defeating as many zombies as they can in a limited amount of time. This mode can be played in teams.<br/>    Versus mode removes the Infected from the game and pits the human characters against each other in a battle for dominance. Players must watch their back as they attempt to defeat each other while staying alive themselves. Watch out because you may find that players are not as merciful as the Infected!<br/><br/><br/>Players take on the role of one of the Heroes of Resident Evil. They start with a deck of 10 cards, which consist of Weapons and Ammo. Players must use their resources to obtain more powerful Weapons, Ammo, Items, and Action Cards that they add to their deck. As you progress in the game your Deck will become stronger and more efficient. You must use the cards in your deck to fight the &quot;Infected&quot; creatures which awards you Decorations . To win the game you must defeat more &quot;Infected&quot; creatures then your opponents, but the game only ends when the strongest &quot;Infected&quot; creatures is killed. Once he is killed, the player that has gained the most Decorations wins the game.<br/> Ammo cards are used to power your Weapons as well as purchase new cards.<br/>Weapon cards are used to battle the &quot;Infected&quot; creatures. Stronger weapons require more ammo.<br/>Item cards allow you to strengthen and Heal your Character.<br/>Action cards give you additional actions that you can take during your turn, such as drawing more cards or improving the power of your weapons.<br/><br/>Integrates with:<br/><br/>    Resident Evil Deck Building Game: Alliance<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Resident Evil Deck Building Game: Outbreak<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 
The Empire must fall. Our mission must succeed. By destroying their key bases, we will shatter Imperial strength and liberate our people. Yet spies have infiltrated our ranks, ready for sabotage. We must unmask them. In five nights we reshape destiny or die trying. We are the Resistance!<br/><br/>The Resistance is a party game of social deduction. It is designed for five to ten players, lasts about 30 minutes, and has no player elimination. The Resistance is inspired by Mafia/Werewolf, yet it is unique in its core mechanics which increase the resources for informed decisions, intensify player interaction, and eliminate player elimination.<br/><br/>Players are either Resistance Operatives or Imperial Spies. For three to five rounds, they must depend on each other to carry out missions against the Empire. At the same time, they must try to deduce the other players&rsquo; identities and gain their trust. Each round begins with discussion. When ready, the Leader entrusts sets of Plans to a certain number of players (possibly including himself/herself). Everyone votes on whether or not to approve the assignment. Once an assignment passes, the chosen players secretly decide to Support or Sabotage the mission. Based on the results, the mission succeeds (Resistance win) or fails (Empire win). When a team wins three missions, they have won the game.<br/><br/>Rule Correction:<br/><br/>For first printing (2010 purchases), the expansion rules should read: &quot;Games of 5-6 players use 7 plot cards, games with 7+ players use all 15 Plot Cards.&quot; and &quot;...each Round the leader draws Plot cards (1 for 5-6 players, 2 for 7-8 players and 3 for 9-10 players)&quot; - This has been corrected in the subsequent printings.<br/><br/> 
The classic wargame Risk has been updated and revised for 2008. The graphics and components are brand new. Major and minor objectives have been added, along with cities and capitals, plus rewards for completing objectives.<br/><br/>The new version has a drastically changed victory condition: complete three objectives while controlling your capital. This shortens the game playing time to around 90 minutes.<br/><br/>There are three rule sets: Basic Training, Command Room and World Conquest. Basic Training is an introduction to the new Risk rules and includes a pre-existing setup for 3, 4 or 5 players. Command Room adds a randomized setup and rewards for achieving objectives. Both Basic Training and Command Room end when a player controls three objectives. World Conquest is an updated version of the classic Risk game of Global Domination: play continues until one player controls all territories.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Risk<br/>    Risk: Black Ops<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Risk: Halo Wars Collector's Edition<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href="http://hasbro.com/risk/default.cfm?page=default" rel="nofollow">http://hasbro.com/risk/default.cfm?page=default</a><br/><br/> 
The Rivals for Catan is a reimplementation of Catan Card Game.<br/><br/>The Rivals for Catan was released in German in September of 2010, on the 15th anniversary of the original card game. An English edition is due out in the fourth quarter of the year. The designer of the game, Klaus Teuber, has stated that he completely reworked many of the original card game's mechanics to make it easier for newcomers to play the game.<br/><br/>Each player portrays a prince for Catan, developing their individual provinces and competing to build a more successful province than the other.  The basic mode of play is similar to the original Catan Card Game, where players expand their provinces by building settlements connected by roads.  Players may also build expansions in their settlements that aid them in various ways, or upgrade their settlements to cities to allow more expansions to be built.  They build these additions by using resources that they accumulate each turn, which are determined by the roll of a die.  Cards are drawn on each turn to replenish the players' hands.  The players may also use action cards that directly affect either their own province or their opponent's province.<br/><br/>The Rivals for Catan features a reduced pool of cards, without the more aggressive style of action cards found in the original Catan Card Game.  Therefore, all action cards will be able to be used from the beginning of the game unlike in the original card game.<br/><br/>Ways to Play:<br/>The Introductory Game focuses on the basics of the card game, featuring gameplay that is more appropriate for newcomers.  This game is played to 7 victory points and includes 36 Expansion Cards in four stacks.  This play style should take beginner players 25 to 30 minutes to play.<br/><br/>Three Theme Games add more rules, expansions, and aggressive cards.  These Theme Games may be played individually or combined to play a variant called &quot;The Duel of the Princes.&quot;  Each Theme Game adds 24 Expansion and Event Cards to the cards from the Introductory Game, which are placed in two stacks separately from the cards from the Introductory Game.  When playing a Theme Game, playtime should be around 45 to 60 minutes.<br/><br/>As with the original Catan Card Game, players can also play the Tournament Game, in which each player chooses specific cards to build their deck ahead of time from which they draw from during the game.<br/><br/>Theme:<br/>The theme of The Rivals for Catan is no longer restricted only to the feudal era of the Middle Ages like the original Catan Card Game.  The Introductory Game portrays the very early years of the world of Catan, while each Theme Game takes place in progressively later eras.  These eras are known as &quot;The Era of Gold,&quot; &quot;The Era of Turmoil,&quot; and &quot;The Era of Progress.&quot;<br/><br/>Expansions:<br/>An expansion containing more cards is scheduled for release in 2011.<br/><br/>Belongs to the Catan Series.<br/><br/> 
From Cocktail Games' website :<br/><br/>&quot;Take your hands out of your pockets &hellip; Get into the dance and follow the rhythm without letting your guard down!<br/><br/>Rhythm and Ball is a game where you tap your knees and clap your hands along to We Will Rock You. Using this well known rhythm you will have to create a series of signs. Each player concerned must repeat his sign before miming an opponent&rsquo;s as quickly as possible. <br/>Your assets will be a sense of rhythm, observation and cunning so as not to be the ball at the end of the chain!<br/><br/>Rhythm and Ball is a game certain to create a crazy atmosphere and should be played until exhaustion sets in.&quot;<br/><br/>By going through the &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; rhythm, you hope that the player whose sign you'll reproduce doesn't realize it's him/her, thus you gain that card, the player who lost gets another. You now have 2 signs that can apply to you.<br/><br/> 
Players roll dice to obtain commodities and workers to build up their civilizations. Dice can be rerolled twice unless they come up as a hazard. Players use their workers to build infrastructure to support additional works or to build monuments that are worth points. At the same time commodities are gathered which allow your civilization to develop. Once all monuments or five developments are achieved by a player the game ends at the end of the round, points are counted, and a victor is declared.<br/><br/>Takes its name from Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization, although the two games have different styles and designers.<br/><br/><br/>     Expanded by Roll Through the Ages: The Late Bronze Age<br/><br/><br/> 
Rook is a trump-based trick-taking game played with a deck of Rook playing cards. It was first sold in 1906 by Parker Brothers.  The Rook deck is similar to a standard deck of cards, but has only numbers from 1-14 in four colors (no face cards or card suits (spades, etc.)).<br/><br/>The standard game is a 4-player partnership game with the 1's, 2's, 3's, and 4's removed for a deck of 41 cards (with the Rook card).  Each hand, players bid for Trump, and then the partnership that won the bid must make the amount of points bid in the hand.  Play of each trick is similar to Whist games like Bridge. The card led must be followed by a card of the same color.  A player may play a trump color if they have none of the color led.  The highest card of the color led wins the trick, unless the trick is trumped, and then the highest trump wins the trick.  The Rook card can be played at any time, and always wins the trick.  Unlike Whist or Bridge, the amount of tricks is not important, but certain count cards (5's, 10's, 14's, and the Rook card) taken in tricks are worth points, which is how the game is scored.<br/><br/>The standard game is 4-player, but there are variants for 2-player and 3-player in the rules, and there also are many variations and house rules used in play.<br/><br/>Rook has also been referred to as Missionary Poker.  The Rook deck, with no-face cards or suits from a standard deck of cards, has often been a card game played by religious groups who object to using a standard deck of cards.<br/><br/> 
Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>An age of innovation and discovery is at hand. With war on the horizon and whisperings of a prophetic storm approaching, now is the time to gather all your strength and set out to forge your place in Terrinoth's book of legends!<br/><br/>Rune Age is a deck-building game of adventure and conquest for 2-4 players. Set in the fantasy realm of Terrinoth (Runebound, Descent: Journeys in the Dark, Runewars, and DungeonQuest), Rune Age puts players in control of one of four races, vying for dominance in a world embroiled in conflict.<br/><br/>Designed by Corey Konieczka, Rune Age is a unique deck-building game that centers around scenarios. The four different scenarios included in Rune Age present alternate win conditions for players, from an all-out war to determine the victor to a cooperative game experience where players all win or lose together. Scenarios not only dictate the win conditions, they also determine which card types will populate Terrinoth (forming the central card pools) and which Event cards will form the Event deck. The Event deck contains thematic challenges, enemies, and happenings that are tied to the chosen scenario, creating a new play environment each turn.<br/><br/>Gameplay in Rune Age centers around players working to develop their individual deck of cards. At the beginning of the game, each player begins with a small assortment of cards in their deck, drawing five cards each turn to carry out their actions. Each player's deck represents their faction's military strength and capabilities. These decks will be formed with their faction-specific Unit cards and a central collection of Neutral Unit cards, Tactics cards, and Gold cards.<br/><br/>While players begin with limited cards in their deck, through cunning and strategic use of their available cards, players can expand their deck to create a destructive force of their own clever design. Will you create brutal deck of formidable Units? Or will you rely on Gold and Influence to acquire neutral forces and powerful Tactics?<br/><br/> 
Players take on the role of dwarves. As miners, they are in a mine, hunting for gold. Suddenly, a pick axe swings down and shatters the mine lamp. The saboteur has struck. But which of the players are saboteurs? Will you find the gold, or will the fiendish actions of the saboteurs lead them to it first? After three rounds, the player with the most gold is the winner.<br/><br/>With the help of Dwarf Cards, the players are assigned their role: either miner or saboteur. The roles are kept secret- they are only revealed at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The Start Card and the three Goal Cards are placed onto the table, each seven card widths apart from each other. The Goal Cards are placed face-down. The gold is on one of the Goal Cards, but nobody knows which.<br/><br/>Players have cards in hand. On a player's turn, he must do one of three things: place a Path Card into the mine, play an Action Card in front of a player, or pass.<br/><br/>The Path Cards form paths leading to the Goal Cards. Path Cards must be played next to a already-played Path Card. All paths on the Path Card must match those on the already-played cards, and Path Cards may not be played sideways.<br/><br/>The miners are trying to build an uninterrupted path from the Start Card to a Goal Card, while the saboteurs are trying to prevent this. They shouldn't try and be too obvious about it, however, lest they be immediately discovered.<br/><br/>Action Cards can be placed in front of any player, including oneself. Action Cards let the players help or hinder one another, as well as obtain information about the Goal Cards.<br/><br/>Once a player places a Path Card that reaches the gold, the round is over. The miners have won and receive cards with gold pieces as their reward.<br/><br/>The round is also over if the gold could not be reached. In that case, the saboteurs have won and receive the gold pieces.<br/><br/>Once the Gold Cards have been distributed, the next round begins. The game is over at the end of the third round, with the player with the most gold pieces being the winner.<br/><br/>Original description of the game came from Adam Spielt.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Saboteur 2 (which includes Saboteur and an expansion)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Saboteur 2 is also available as an expansion on its own.<br/><br/> 
Gigamic's Saboteur 2 is an expanded version of Frederic Moyersoen's Saboteur, which first appeared in 2004 from Amigo Spiel. (The English Z-Man Games version is an expansion for Saboteur.) Each player takes on the role of a gold-digging dwarf or a saboteur who wants to hinder exploration of the gold mines -- but each player knows only his own role, so the digging may or may not go as planned!<br/><br/>Each turn, a player lays down a tunnel card to dig from the start card toward one of the goal cards (or potentially away, if a saboteur) or plays an action card to help or hinder someone. If the diggers manage to find the gold hidden under one of the goal cards, then the diggers share the loot found there; if the gold can't be reached, the saboteurs profit instead. After three rounds, the player with the most gold wins.<br/><br/>The original Saboteur allowed 3-10 players, while Saboteur 2 handles 2-12 players. Saboteur 2 includes the original game (not included in the Zman US/English edition), along with additional role cards (the boss, profiteers, geologists), new action cards (steal gold, change your role), and new tunnel cards featuring doors, ladders and bridges. What's more, the gold seekers can now be divided into teams -- blue vs. green -- and only those on the team that finds the gold score anything, assuming they do of course...<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Saboteur<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 
In Kakerlakensalat players create a common salad packed with lettuce, peppers, tomatoes and cauliflower &ndash; but they won't always be saying which ingredient they're adding to the bowl!<br/><br/>The 128 cards &ndash; 120 vegetable cards in the four types and eight &quot;taboo&quot; vegetable cards, two of each type that bear cockroaches &ndash; are shuffled and divided among the players. On a turn, a player plays the top card from his deck onto the central pile of cards, naming the vegetable as he plays it, e.g., &quot;Pepper!&quot; &ndash; except in the following situations:<br/><br/>&bull; If his vegetable matches the previously played vegetable, the player must lie.<br/>&bull; If his vegetable matches the claim made by the previous player (perhaps because that player lied), then the player must lie.<br/>&bull; If he plays a taboo card, he shouts &quot;Cockroach!&quot; and the next player starts a new pile next to the first one so that the taboo card remains visible.<br/>&bull; If his vegetable matches a visible taboo card, he must lie.<br/><br/>Make a mistake or stumble or hesitate too long, and a player must pick up all cards played to that point in the game. The first player to run out of cards wins!<br/><br/>Can be combined with Kakerlakensuppe.<br/><br/> 
Rich merchants and their families ply the Silk Route of the Orient with their caravans in order to make lucrative business. The players assume the role of traders who marry into other families to extend their influences. Who will be the richest merchant?<br/><br/>Samarkand is a family game with its simple to understand rules and fast access to play.<br/><br/>This entry has been split from the Winsome Games publication Age of Scheme: Routes to Riches.

Say Anything is a light-hearted game about what you and your friends think. It gives you the chance to settle questions that have been hotly debated for centuries. For instance, &quot;What is the most overrated band of all time?&quot; or &quot;Which celebrity would be the most fun to hang out with for a day?&quot; So dig deep into your heart or just come up with something witty - this is your chance to Say Anything!<br/><br/>How to Play<br/>1) Ask a question from the card you draw. Ex:<br/>- If you could have a &quot;BIG&quot; anything, what would it be?<br/>- What's the most important invention of the last century?<br/>- Which website would be hardest to live without?<br/>- What's the best activity for a first date?<br/>- What's the worst thing to say to a cop after getting pulled over?<br/><br/>2) Everyone else writes an answer and throws it face-up on the table as fast as possible.  No duplicate answers are allowed!<br/><br/>3) Secretly choose your favorite response using a genuine state of the art SELECT-O-MATIC 5000 (see pictures).<br/><br/>4) Everyone else has two betting tokens to bet on which answer you chose.  They can bet both tokens on one answer or split them between two different answers (just like in Wits &amp; Wagers).<br/><br/>Who Will Like This Game?<br/>Say Anything is a pure party game.  It was designed to get a party started as quickly as possible by prompting people to talk about interesting things and to make ridiculous statements.  Although it was designed by the makers of Wits & Wagers, it is a much lighter game.  Wits &amp; Wagers can be played strategically or as a boisterous party game, but Say Anything can only be played as a pure party game.  If you are looking for great social interaction and lots of laughs, then you will probably enjoy playing Say Anything.<br/><br/>History<br/>Say Anything was designed by Dominic Crapuchettes &amp; Satish Pillalamarri - the designers of Wits &amp; Wagers.  It was first work-shopped by game designers at Protospiel 2004 and refined at Protospiel 2005, PowWow 2005, the GoF 2005 - 2007, and weekly game nights at the Looney Labs.<br/><br/> 
Say Anything Family will feature the same game play as North Star Games' 2008 release Say Anything.<br/><br/>To summarize game play, one player asks a question (e.g., &quot;Which magical power would be the coolest to have?&quot;), each other player writes an answer they think the asker will choose, the asker secretly chooses an answer, everyone else bets on which answer was chosen, then the asker reveals his choice. If players guessed correctly, then they score one point for each chip they placed on the correct answer; the player whose answer was chosen scores one point; the asker scores one point for each chip on the answer chosen, up to a maximum of three. After a certain number of rounds, the game ends and the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>Say Anything Family will include 360 questions on topics that kids can handle as easily as adults. The game includes components for six players, as opposed to eight in the first game.<br/><br/> 
&quot;The Game of Scattergories,&quot; published in 1988 by Milton Bradley, is a great game for any group to play. In the game each player fills out a category list 'with answers that begin with the same letter.' If no other player matches your answers, you score points. The game is played in rounds. After 3 rounds a winner is declared, and a new game can be begun.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Scattergories Refill<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Scattergories Junior<br/>    Scattergories: Bible Edition<br/>    Electronic Scattergories Platinum Edition (Electronic)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 
In this classic word game, players use their seven drawn letter-tiles to form words on the gameboard.  Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses.  But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word.  This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.<br/><br/>Skip-a-cross was licensed by Selchow & Righter and manufactured by Cadaco. Both games have identical rules but Skip-a-cross has tiles and racks made of cardboard instead of wood. The game was also published because not enough Scrabble games were manufactured to meet the demand.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Alfapet (Swedish)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 
Each card contains 1-3 matching objects, in one of three colors, shapes, and shadings. Twelve cards are laid out, and the first person to spot a set of three collects those cards. The cards are replaced from the deck and play continues.<br/><br/>A set consists of three cards that are either all alike or all different in each attribute: for instance, if all three cards have the same number of objects, but different shapes, shadings, and colors, then they're a set.   If two of the cards have a common attribute that is not shared by the third, they are not a set.<br/><br/>Re-implemented as a dice game with Set Cubed.<br/><br/> 
In Settlers of Catan, players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads.  On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces.  Players collect these resources to build up their civilizations to get to 10 victory points and win the game.  Multi-award-winning and one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to non-gamers and gamers alike.<br/><br/>Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by Kosmos and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone at least 4 editions as Settlers of Catan. It has also been re-published in a travel edition by Kosmos and in yet another edition for Japan/Asia, Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition.<br/><br/>Settlers of Catan is the original game in the Catan Series.<br/><br/>

This is an expansion for The Settlers of Catan. Players can build shipping lanes, which are very similar to roads. Additionally, the game comes with many different water-hex-heavy variant setups. The American version (Mayfair) should only be used with the American base game, instead of the German one (Kosmos), because of matching components and for the same reason, the Kosmos German version should only be used with the German base game.

Traders &amp; Barbarians is distributed as the third major expansion for The Settlers of Catan, although it is actually a compilation of small expansions and variants.  (It is independent of the Seafarers and Cities & Knights expansions, but can be combined with them.)<br/><br/>All of the variants and three of the scenarios have been available from various sources in Europe and the United States or through official websites. The Great Rivers and the Fishermen of Catan have been expanded somewhat for this expansion through extra tiles and player pieces.<br/><br/>This compilation includes 5 scenarios:<br/><br/>     The Fishermen of Catan - Originally released in the 05/2006 Spielbox magazine and then subsequently released in Games Quarterly magazine.

Expanded in this edition to include two rivers, one occupying 4 tiles, and one occupying 3.<br/>     The Great Caravan - Originally released as a free expansion in Germany.<br/>     Barbarian Invasion - New in this edition. - Barbarians are invading Catan and the players have to try to stop them with new knight pieces. This plays very similarly to the flood mechanic in the Atlantis scenario from the Atlantis and Das Buch scenario packs.<br/>     Traders &amp; Barbarians - New in this edition. - You get new hexes, one for the castle, one to produce glass, and one to produce marble. You try to rebuild Catan after the invasion. You get gold and victory points if you finish tasks in the castle, but to do so you have to travel back and forth to the castle on roads and undeveloped paths. There are still some barbarians around who interfere with trade routes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>It also includes 4 minor variants:<br/><br/>     2-Player Rules - Use the new &quot;Commercial Chips&quot; to force trade with your oppenent.

In most games, players compete against each other to achieve victory. Shadows over Camelot proposes a journey of a very different kind, where you and your fellow players, as Knights of the Round Table, will collaborate to jointly defeat... the game!<br/><br/>At first glance, this task seems simple enough. After all, shouldn&rsquo;t a band of young and noble Knights - fleet of foot and sound of mind - easily defeat a game that plays itself? Alas your quest is further complicated by the ever-present possibility of a Traitor in your midst, biding his time, waiting to strike at the worst possible moment...<br/><br/>But enough words... Don your cloak, climb astride your warhorse and gallop into the Shadows to join us in Camelot!<br/><br/> 
From DOW blog<br/><br/>Merlin&rsquo;s Company is a new expansion for the popular Shadows over Camelot board game. It introduces a host of new characters - including 7 new knights and Merlin himself - to the Shadows over Camelot epic.

He travels the board lending guidance and a helping hand to the embattled knights.<br/><br/>Merlin&rsquo;s Company also introduces 63 new cards: the all new Travel cards - events that may occur as you move from Quest to Quest; additional Black cards, including 7 witches allied with Morgan; and additional White cards that will help you and your fellow knights in your battles against the forces of evil.<br/><br/>The Merlin&rsquo;s Company expansion supports up to 8 players, including 2 possible Traitors, assuring that even the most innocuous Shadows over Camelot Quest will be filled with grave peril.<br/><br/>Evenings at the Round Table have never been more exciting than with Merlin&rsquo;s Company - the new expansion for Shadows over Camelot!<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Shadows over Camelot<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 
The players put together four shows in any order: Queenie, Wolf, King Lear, and Ballet.  To accomplish this, players draft actor cards from a constantly changing queue of cards.  Each card represents actors of varying skills at roles.  Once a player puts together all the needed roles for a show, the value is judged against all the other productions of that type, with points given relative to the other productions.<br/><br/>This is a Queen Games reprint of the db-Spiele original, Premiere.<br/><br/>Re-implemented as:<br/><br/><br/>     Atlantic Star<br/><br/><br/> 
A number of cards showing faces are displayed face up. Players must try to remember the various features of each face. After one minute, the cards are shuffled and all but one are turned face up. Players then draw the missing person as they remember him. All the drawings are revealed and everybody votes for the one that most closely matches the original. Drawings are then scored according to six features: face shape, eyes, nose, mouth, hair and the extras. Players score points for their drawings and for voting correctly. An helper sheet helps players remember and draw the various features.<br/><br/> 
Edited description from Bruno Faidutti's write-up of the game in his Ideal Game Library:<br/><br/>Skull &amp; Roses is the quintessence of bluffing, a game in which everything is played in the players' heads. Each player plays a face-down card, then each player in turn adds one more card &ndash; until someone feels safe enough to state that he can turn a number of cards face up and get only roses. Other players can then overbid him, saying they can turn even more cards face up. The highest bidder must then turn that number of cards face up, starting with his own. If he shows only roses, he wins; if he reveals a skull, he loses, placing one of his cards out of play. Two succcessful challenges wins the game. That's all. Skull &amp; Roses is not a game of luck; it's a game of poker face and meeting eyes.<br/><br/>Integrates with:<br/><br/>    Skull & Roses Red<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 
Absolutely genuine classic deduction game from the master designer Sid Sackson. There are two decks, one normal size, 36 cards showing 1,2,or 3 diamonds, pearls or opals, in 4 colors, red, green, blue &amp; yellow. This deck is shuffled and one removed and hidden; the missing gem for you to discover. The remaining cards are dealt out, any spare are turned up. The other deck is 54 small Search cards, showing one or two elements, eg diamonds, pairs, or blue opals, red pearls, or free choices. Players are dealt 4 each face up. You then select one, ask one player how many they have of that type. So ask for Pairs and the player will say &quot;3&quot; if it has the Blue Diamond Pair, the Yellow Pearl Pair and the Green Pearl Pair. But if you ask them for the Red Diamonds, they must pass them over to you to look at in secret, but also declare to the other players how many are being passed.<br/><br/>Players have simple score pads showing the 36 gems on which to record information. Discard the Search card and draw another. You can declare your deduction at any time, or on your turn ask one question without having the Search card and then immediately declare. Mark your sheet, check the missing gem. If you're wrong, you keep playing, but only answering questions. If you're correct, you win.<br/><br/>The simplicity of the rules and the cards belies the complexity of the game. It is the mixture of seeing some cards, but only getting told numbers for others, that makes it hard to deduce. Any notation you devise has to be flexible but reliable, and it is as important to record negative information as well as positive detail.<br/><br/>The game was part of 3M's classic range of games (3M Gamette Series), but has been re-issued by Face2Face.<br/><br/>Sleuth is a stripped down version of The Case of the Elusive Assassin-- featuring the core mechanics of the original game without the board.

In Small World, players vie for conquest and control of a world that is simply too small to accommodate them all.<br/><br/>Designed by Philippe Keyaerts as a fantasy follow-up to his award-winning Vinci, Small World is inhabited by a zany cast of characters such as dwarves, wizards, amazons, giants, orcs, and even humans, who use their troops to occupy territory and conquer adjacent lands in order to push the other races off the face of the earth.<br/><br/>Picking the right combination from the 14 different fantasy races and 20 unique special powers, players rush to expand their empires - often at the expense of weaker neighbors. Yet they must also know when to push their own over-extended civilization into decline and ride a new one to victory!<br/><br/>Reimplements:<br/><br/><br/>     Vinci (released in 1999)<br/><br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Small World Underground (released in 2011)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Clarifications: available in a pinned forum post.<br/><br/> 
&quot;This world's not big enough for all of us, so it's time you step aside to make room for me.&quot;<br/><br/>That's the spirit of Philippe Keyaerts' award-winning Small World, and the 2011 release Small World Underground is a standalone game that keeps that spirit intact, while putting a new spin on the game play.<br/><br/>Small World Underground includes 15 fantasy-themed races of creatures along with 21 special powers. Each player will control several creature/power combinations over the course of the game &ndash; spending points to draft these combinations &ndash; and will use those creatures to claim control of various subterranean locations. Some locations hold relics or are designated as &quot;places of power&quot;, and monsters must first be conquered before a player can claim these special benefits. At the end of each turn, a player scores points for the regions he holds, and the player with the most points at game end wins.<br/><br/>Small World Underground is playable on its own, but can be combined with other Small World releases. The publisher recommends that players be familiar with Small World before playing Small World Underground.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>     Small World<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

From the Publisher:<br/>Spring/Summer 2010<br/>Pitch: Ancient Egypt... The temple of Sobek is being built and the market place is thriving. Loads of goods arrive by ship for the construction site and it is a race to pick the best items in order to sell them with the most profit.<br/><br/>Of course, with so much at stake, not all the moves are legal, corruption is everywhere and cordiality scarce. Because in the end there can be only one winner!<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Famous Bruno Cathala's (Cyclades, Dice Town, Shadows Over Camelot, Mr. Jack, MOW...) latest design is a fast paced card game well suited for the whole family, with tactical choices, luck, and a bit of cunning.<br/><br/>Each turn you have to choose if you want to take a goods card, play a character with a special power or display a set of matching goods cards.<br/>While taking a profitable card, you often collect corruption points, which add up in a pile in front of you. <br/>During each each round five sets of nine cards are put at the players' disposal. When all cards are gone, there is a scoring for all displayed cards, but beware, the player with the most corruption sigils sees his income almost cut down in half.<br/><br/>The game ends after 3 rounds or if a player has reached a hundred points.<br/><br/> 
Slide Pursuit Game<br/><br/>Race your four game pieces from Start around the board to your Home in this Pachisi type game. By turning over a card from the draw deck and following its instructions, players move their pieces around the game board, switch places with players, and knock opponents' pieces off the track and back to their Start position.<br/><br/>Slides are located at various places around the game board. When a player's piece lands at the beginning of one of these slides not of its own color, it automatically advances to the end, removing any opponent's piece on the slide and sending it back to Start.<br/><br/>Game moves are directed exclusively by cards from the play-action deck.  If one plays the normal version in which one card is drawn from the deck each turn, the outcome has a huge element of luck.  Sorry can be made more of a strategic game (and more appealing to adults) by dealing five cards to each player at the start of the game and allowing the player to choose which card he/she will play each turn.  In this version, at the end of each turn, a new card is drawn from the deck to replace the card that was played, so that each player is always working from five cards.<br/><br/>A player's fortunes can change dramatically in one or two rounds of play through the use of Sorry cards, the &quot;11&quot; cards (which give the player the option of trading places with an opponent's piece on the track), and the fact that it is possible to move from Start to Home without circumnavigating the full board by making judicious use of the &quot;backward 4&quot; cards.<br/><br/> 
Players take on the role of Captain of a salvaged Starship. They will search for new allies such as Picard, Data, and other famous Characters. They will Explore space to complete Missions, Encounter Events, and meet Starships that could be friend or foe.<br/><br/>The game will feature 3 separate scenarios of play:<br/><br/>Explorations (Free For All): Explore Space to complete Missions, Encounter Events, and Engage Starships.<br/>Borg Invasion (Cooperative): The Borg have come to Assimilate you and everything you know. Band together with your fellow Captains to defend your world and fend off the Borg.<br/>Klingon Civil War (Teams): A rift in power has been created in the Klingon Empire. Form an alliance, gather support, and defeat your enemies to obtain control of the Empire.<br/><br/>The goal of each game varies. While some simply require a point threshold, another game's goal might be to simply survive.<br/><br/> 
Star Trek: Expeditions is a board game for up to four players, set in the &quot;New Universe&quot; of Star Trek, as seen in the 2009 movie. It is built upon the cooperative board game model and the players will work together against the game itself.<br/><br/>In the game, players assume the roles of Kirk, Spock, Bones and Uhura. The premise is the Federation has received a petition for membership from a planet and the Enterprise is dispatched to assess their application. When the Enterprise arrives, they discover:<br/><br/><br/>     A Klingon battle cruiser is in orbit;<br/>     Civil war is threatening to break out on the planet;<br/>     And the planet is (coincidentally?) reconsidering its application for UFP membership.<br/><br/><br/>Your mission is threefold; defuse the threat of civil war, deal with the Klingon threat and get the planet to join the UFP. And you only have 30 days (roughly equaling 30 turns) in which to do it. or a Klingon battle fleet will warp in and you will be forced to withdraw (thus failing your mission).<br/><br/>Each objective is tracked on a scoresheet that monitors your progress. Decisions you make in the game as well as how you interact with the other players will affect the outcome of the mission.<br/><br/>The four figures are fully rendered, 3D versions of the four Bridge officers. The four figures and two spaceships are similar to Heroclix figures, with the clicks on the dials at the base of the figure representing damage and corresponding diminished abilities.<br/><br/>This product is designed as a non-collectible, non-blind, all-in-one-and-done game, but is built upon the &quot;expandable&quot; board game model meaning that down the line, new missions and crew members will be made available for folk to play other &quot;episodes&quot;!<br/><br/> 
Martin Wallace's new train game is published by Mayfair. The game is of the same family of rail games as Age of Steam and Railroad Tycoon, both previous games designed by Wallace.<br/><br/>The game plays very similarly to Age of Steam but with modifications to some of its mechanics and artwork. Tracks for income, train level, etc. are all printed on the board around the map such that alternate maps can be overlaid on the board and the necessary tracks will still be able to be used.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>     Age of Steam<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Similar to:<br/><br/>     Railroad Tycoon<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 
Players struggle to survive the Stone Age by working as hunters, collectors, farmers, and tool makers. As you gather resources and raise animals, you work to build the tools needed to build your civilization.<br/><br/>Players use up to 10 tribe members each in 3 phases. In the first phase, players place their men in regions of the board that they think will benefit them, including the hunt, the trading center, or the quarry. In the second phase, the starting player activates each of his staffed areas in whatever sequence he chooses, followed in turn by the other players. In the third phase, players must have enough food available to feed their populations, or they face losing resources or points.<br/><br/> 
From the box:<br/><br/>&quot;The gameboard is your battlefield.  You have an army of men at your disposal and six bombs.  Your mission--protect your flag and capture your opponent's flag.<br/><br/>&quot;Secretly place your men, bombs, and flag on the gameboard with these objectives in mind.  But remember your opponent is doing the same thing, so you must plan a defense as well as an offense.<br/><br/>&quot;Once the armies are in place, advance your men.  When you're one space away from an enemy, attack.  You and your opponent declare ranks.  The lower-ranking man is captured and out of play.<br/><br/>&quot;You control your pieces and risk your men in battles where the strength of your enemy is unknown. The suspense builds as your men move deeper into enemy territory. Move with caution and courage. The next piece you attack could be a bomb.  And when attacked, it could &quot;blast&quot; your man off the board and out of play.<br/><br/>&quot;The first to capture an enemy flag is the winner!&quot;<br/><br/>This game is similar to, and almost certainly derived directly from, the H.P. Gibsons (UK) game L'Attaque (1909). It is not exactly the same, but not far from it (numbered pieces, spy (same name) can kill the strongest piece but only when attacking, flag, bombs, etc.)<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>     Stratego (Revised Edition) (aka Stratego Fire &amp; Ice)<br/>     The Generals<br/>     Stratego: Legends<br/>     Stratego: Star Wars<br/>     Stratego: Lord of the Rings<br/>     Ultimate Stratego<br/>     Electronic Stratego<br/>     Stratego: Marvel Heroes<br/>     Stratego: Star Wars Saga Edition<br/>     Stratego: The Chronicles of Narnia<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>and numerous others.<br/><br/>Similar to:<br/><br/>    Lu Zhan Jun Qi<br/>    L'Attaque<br/>    Batalj<br/>    Sharpe's Attack<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 
For quite some time the famous and respected sultan is looking for a husband for his only daughter who suits him.

Summoner Wars is a fast-playing, action-packed card game for 2-4 players in which they take on the role of Summoners: powerful beings who harness the power of mysterious Summoning Stones to lead their race to conquest on the war-torn planet of Itharia. These Summoners wield terrible magic on the battlefield, freezing their foes in place, draining their enemies of power, and even bringing rains of fire down from the heavens. But most notoriously, they summon their great race's hordes of warriors to the battlefield, to clash in the never-ending struggle for supremacy. A Summoner is both mage and general, and must combine their wizardly might with clever tactics to defeat the enemy Summoner on the opposite side of the battle.<br/><br/>The Summoner Wars Master Set contains six new and different complete factions from which to choose:<br/><br/>&bull; Play as the Shadow Elves and conceal your plans in swirling darkness!<br/>&bull; Choose the Benders and confound your foe, turning his own troops against him!<br/>&bull; Command the Vargath, mountainous goatfolk who call lightning from the heavens!<br/>&bull; Select the nefarious Sand Goblins and delight in malicious trickery!<br/>&bull; Muster the Deep Dwarves and control the forces of Geomancy!<br/>&bull; Lead the ferocious Swamp Orcs to war and hack upon your foes as they are snared in your vines!<br/><br/>Strategy shapes the composition of each deck of cards and how they are used. Tactics determine the effectiveness of those cards in battle. Call walls of stone to protect you in combat and serve as magic portals for you to summon your warriors. Call your forces forth and send them in a surging wave against your enemy. Cast spells that bolster your forces and cut down those who would oppose you.<br/><br/>Victory can come only from the death of your opponent's Summoner...<br/><br/>

The opposing partners watch a timer and use a buzzer to stop the game, buzz the player describing if one of the five off limits words or phrases is used, or the describing player makes any gestures.

Through the Ages is a civilization building game. The goal is to develop your civilization, not to destroy other ones. Military strength is just one aspect of your nation, as well as population, production or science. It is up to you which aspect you will concentrate on, more or less, but you should not underestimate any of them while building your civilization.<br/><br/>Victory is achieved by the player whose nation produces the most culture during the game. However, there are many ways to produce culture: through religion, literature or drama, by building wonders, by utilizing cultural persons etc. Considerable amount of culture can be gained even via wars or aggression.<br/><br/> 
Each player attempts to score the most points by snaking caravan routes through the desert, trying to reach oases and blocking off sections of the desert. Many people feel that it is reminiscent of Go.<br/><br/>Publisher's Description<br/>From the award-winning game designer Reiner Knizia comes a game of strategy, patience, and cool plastic camels! The desert is still treacherous, mysterious, and without mercy. But for those willing to risk the dangers of the shifting, sun-baked sands, the desert holds riches beyond compare.<br/> In Through the Desert, two to five players each control a tribe of nomads vying for control of the desert. By establishing caravans and taking over oases, the players gain points as their tribes increase in power.<br/> Strategy is essential in deciding how and where to build your tribe's caravans. There are multiple ways to gain points and several ways to win. Should you try to build the longest caravan? Or should you dominate the desert's oases? Don't forget to keep an eye on your opponents' caravans, or you may find your own tribe cut off from valuable water holes.<br/><br/>Through the Desert is part of the Knizia tile-laying trilogy.<br/><br/>

With elegantly simple gameplay, Ticket to Ride can be learned in 3 minutes, while providing players with intense strategic and tactical decisions every turn. Players collect cards of various types of train cars they then use to claim railway routes in North America. The longer the routes, the more points they earn. Additional points come to those who fulfill Destination Tickets &ndash; goal cards that connect distant cities; and to the player who builds the longest continuous route.<br/><br/>&quot;The rules are simple enough to write on a train ticket &ndash; each turn you either draw more cards, claim a route, or get additional Destination Tickets,&quot; says Ticket to Ride author, Alan R. Moon. &quot;The tension comes from being forced to balance greed &ndash; adding more cards to your hand, and fear &ndash; losing a critical route to a competitor.&quot;<br/><br/>Ticket to Ride continues in the tradition of Days of Wonder's big format board games featuring high-quality illustrations and components including: an oversize board map of North America, 225 custom-molded train cars, 144 illustrated cards, and wooden scoring markers.<br/><br/>Since its introduction and numerous subsequent awards, Ticket to Ride has become the BoardGameGeek epitome of a &quot;gateway game&quot; -- simple enough to be taught in a few minutes, and with enough action and tension to keep new players involved and in the game for the duration.<br/><br/>Part of the Ticket to Ride series.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Ticket to Ride: Europe<br/>    Ticket to Ride: Märklin Edition<br/>    Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries<br/>    Ticket to Ride: The Card Game<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 
The Ticket to Ride Europa 1912 expansion for the Ticket to Ride series includes 101 Destination Tickets - the 46 original tickets, plus 55 new ones that enable 3 new variants to the Ticket to Ride Europe map: Europe Expanded, which adds 19 new routes to the original 46; Big Cities of Europe, with tickets to 9 major European cities; and Mega Europe, which uses all the new routes as well as the 46 original Destination Tickets.<br/><br/>This expansion also introduces Warehouses &amp; Depots - new game rules and pieces that create an additional strategic layer and can be played with any of the Ticket to Ride maps. Wooden Train Depots are placed on cities selected by each player. Throughout the game, each player's Warehouse will accumulate Train cards and those who have the foresight, clever timing, or just plain good fortune to build a route to a Depot can make off with a fistful of Train cards. Depot placement and skillful Warehouse tactics become a key part of a winning Ticket to Ride strategy!<br/><br/> 
Ticket to Ride: USA 1910 is a card expansion for the original Ticket to Ride boardgame, winner of the 2004 Spiel des Jahres. It contains 181 large format cards (the same size as Ticket to Ride: Europe and Ticket to Ride: Märklin Edition).  This includes 35 new 1910 Destination Tickets, a GlobeTrotter Bonus card for completing the most tickets, 4 Mystery Train Destination Tickets originally provided in the Ticket to Ride: Mystery Train Expansion expansion, and a complete replacement deck of the 141 cards from the original game deck (30 Destination Tickets (4 cards have a reduced value from Ticket to Ride), 110 Train Cards, and 1 Longest Route Bonus Card (Trans America Express)).<br/><br/>The rulebook is from the original game designer Alan R. Moon that gives you three additional different ways to play the game:<br/><br/>     The 1910 Rules: Played as the standard Ticket to Ride, but using only the 1910 Destination Tickets, and GlobeTrotter Bonus card.<br/>     The Big Cities Rules: Played with only the newly identified 35 &quot;Big City&quot; Destination Tickets (15 Standard Tickets, 19 1910 Tickets, and 1 Mystery Train Ticket).<br/>     The Mega Game: featuring all of the game's Destination Tickets and Bonus Cards (30 Standard Tickets, 35 1910 Tickets, 4 Mystery Train Tickets, and both Bonus cards).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 
Alvin &amp; Dexter &ndash; A Ticket to Ride Monster Expansion can be added to any of the various standalone Ticket to Ride games that designer Alan R. Moon and publisher Days of Wonder have released since 2004.<br/><br/>These monsters stymie players both during the game and once it ends. During play, no routes can be built into or out of a city where Alvin or Dexter are currently nesting, and during the final score tallying, any destination ticket showing a city where either monster stands is worth only half its normal value.<br/><br/>Desperately need to build a route to Seattle, Paris, or wherever else a roaming monster has set up shop? Discard one (or two) wild locomotive cards, and you can move the monster up to three (or six) cities away from its current location. Move a monster more than any other player, and you'll pick up an endgame bonus for your role as monster minder.<br/><br/> 
Ticket to Ride: Europe takes you on a new train adventure across Europe. From Edinburgh to Constantinople and from Lisbon to Moscow, you'll visit great cities of turn-of-the-century Europe. More than just a new map, Ticket to Ride: Europe features brand new gameplay elements including Tunnels, Ferries and Train Stations. The game also includes larger format cards and Train Station game pieces.<br/><br/>Like the original Ticket to Ride, the game remains elegantly simple, can be learned in 5 minutes, and appeals to both families and experienced gamers. Ticket to Ride: Europe is a complete, new game and does not require the original version.<br/><br/>Part of the Ticket to Ride series.<br/><br/> Online Play <br/><br/>     Xbox LIVE Arcade<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Ticket to Ride: Europa 1912<br/>    Ticket to Ride: Switzerland<br/>    Ticket to Ride: The Dice Expansion<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Ticket to Ride<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

Regarded by many as Reiner Knizia's masterpiece, the game is set in the ancient fertile crescent with players building civilizations through tile placement.  Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government.  The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories.  However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized.  Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict.  Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.<br/><br/>NOTE: More recent editions of the game by Mayfair and Pegasus (possibly among other publishers) contain a double sided board and extra components for playing the advanced version of the game.<br/><br/>Part of what is considered Reiner Knizia's tile-laying trilogy.<br/><br/>The Hans im Glück version states it is for 2-4 players; the Mayfair Games version states it is for 3-4 players.<br/><br/> Re-implemented by: <br/><br/><br/>     Euphrates & Tigris Card Game<br/><br/><br/> Expanded by: <br/><br/><br/>     Euphrat & Tigris: Die Zikkurat<br/><br/><br/> 
Tikal is a game of exploration within the Central American jungles in search of lost temples and the treasures within. Players send their team of explorers into the jungle, exposing more and more of the terrain.  Along the way, you find temples that require further uncovering and treasures.  Players attempt to score points for occupying temples and holding onto treasure.<br/><br/>Tikal is the first game of the Mask Trilogy.<br/><br/>Reimplemented by:<br/><br/>     Tikal II: The Lost Temple<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 
From the Publisher:<br/>Tikal was discovered and explored during a very successful expedition led by Profs. Kramer and Kiesling. A decade later, a scroll is found, that hints of a lost temple near the first site. This rumor rekindles their passion for Tikal and the two scientists start to discuss the prospect of another expedition to Central America. In the midst of their planning they encounter Profs. Braff and Pauchon at an international archaeology conference in Geneva, who want to know the truth about the enticing rumor.<br/><br/>Later that day, sitting in front of a roaring fire, after a fine meal, finished off with Cuban cigars, and a few brandies, the two Swiss scientists listen enthralled by the unfolding plans of their German colleagues. To a man they clamor their unanimous assent and it is decided to join forces and go back to Tikal. Appointments are made, patrons are found, equipment is assembled, notes are compared, and then they are off.<br/><br/>An uneventful journey takes them to Guatemala, and then on to the old site. Not too long after, they discover that there is indeed an undisturbed temple, in an adjacent valley. As it belonged to a long-forgotten king, the temple promises many surprises and much, much gold. And so the adventure begins...<br/><br/><br/>Tikal II: The Lost Temple is a sequel to 1999 Spiel des Jahres winner Tikal, from world-famous duo Kramer-Kiesling.<br/><br/>Actions points have given place to two actions per turn :<br/>1) move part of your expedition around the board to choose an action tile and then<br/>2) move your head scientist within the temple to explore new rooms and find gold.<br/><br/>There are many ways to score. Collecting and delivering treasures is one, having the majority in some rooms, exploring the main temple as well as an outer secret chamber are others.<br/><br/>Tikal II calls for careful planning, as your scientist can't move freely within the temple without specific items, and tension, as the actions around the board grow scarce. A game consists of two rounds, each concluded by a scoring. In the end, the player with the most gold is declared winner.<br/><br/> 
Time's Up Deluxe is the tenth anniversary edition of one of the most popular party games for gamers! This is a brand new edition, with the best of the cards from the base set and the two expansions (525 cards), a whole bunch of new cards, and best of all, a very handy new electronic timer.<br/><br/>Time's Up! is a party game for teams of two or more players (best with teams of two). The same set of famous names is used for each of three rounds. In each round, one member of a team tries to get his teammates to guess as many names as possible in 30 seconds. In round 1, almost any kind of clue is allowed. In round 2 no more than one word can be used in each clue (but unlimited sounds and gestures are permitted). In round 3, no words are allowed at all.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Time's Up!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 
Based on the popular game Time's Up! Time's Up: Title Recall challenges players to guess the titles of books, films, songs, and more. Players try to get other players to guess the same set of titles over three rounds. In each round, one member of a team tries to get his teammates to guess as many titles as possible in 30 seconds. In round 1, almost any kind of clue is allowed. In round 2 no more than one word can be used in each clue (but unlimited sounds and gestures are permitted.) In round 3, no words are allowed at all.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Time's Up!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 
Tobago is an adventure game, in which the players possess different parts of treasure maps. During the game more and more information about the locations of the treasures are revealed, and the possible locations are narrowed down. When a player identifies the location of one of the treasures they try to reach it as fast as possible to secure the findings.<br/><br/>The game features a modular game board.<br/><br/> 
While this game appears to be very simple, that isn't necessarily the case.  The board is an oval movement track, with points allocated to the various spaces.  Seven different colored 'spies' are placed on the board.  When it's a player's turn, he rolls a die and then moves any combination of characters forward that number of spaces.  The newly-moved spies then score points based on the their new location.  However, the trick here is that each player's color isn't known until the end of the game, so players are encouraged to deduce which color belongs to whom.  In addition, there are some advanced rules which allow players to score more points at the end of the game for correctly guessing everyone's identity.  Heimlich is a German adjective meaning secretly and slyly.  So Heimlich &amp; Co translates as Clandestine and Company!<br/><br/> 
Train of Thought is a party word game. Players take turns trying to get opponents to guess a particular word, giving only a 3 word clue - and one of those words must be from a prior answer! For each clue given, each player may make 1 guess. If none are correct, the clue-giver creates another clue, using one of the guesses and up to 2 other words.<br/><br/>When the word is correctly guessed, the guessing player and the clue giver each get one point, and the clue giver draws a new card and continues making clues. Get as many as you can in 2 minutes!<br/><br/>Train of Thought really makes you think differently than other games in the genre. An excellent party game!<br/><br/> 
A very simple railway game.  Each player has a set of 5 cities strung across the US that need to be connected by rail.  Players place either 1 or 2 rails each turn.  The game ends when the first player completes a connected route between his 5 cities. The player who can make the best use of the other players' networks is generally victorious.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/><br/>    Iron Road<br/><br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/><br/>    TransEuropa<br/><br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/><br/>    Vexation<br/><br/><br/>Awards<br/><br/><br/>     2002 Japan Boardgame Prize Winner, The Best Foreign Game for Beginners.<br/><br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     BrettspielWelt (real-time)<br/>     Cycloops (turn-based)<br/><br/><br/> 
Now it is time to go railroading in Europa. Just like TransAmerica, players work together building a railroad network, but this time it is across Europe instead of the United States.

&quot;Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are &ndash; but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle...&quot;<br/>&ndash; John F. Kennedy<br/><br/>In 1945, unlikely allies toppled Hitler's war machine, while humanity's most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great powers, there then stood only two. The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year  dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new &quot;superpowers&quot; scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing.<br/><br/>Twilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT's other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one's cards and units given consistently limited resources?<br/><br/>Twilight Struggle's Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Arab- Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation. Subsystems capture the prestige-laden Space Race as well as nuclear tensions, with the possibility of game-ending nuclear war.<br/><br/>A deluxe edition, published in 2009 includes the following changes from the basic game:<br/><br/>     Mounted map with revised graphics<br/>     Two double-thick counter sheets with 260 counters<br/>     Deck of 110 event cards (increased from 104)<br/>     Revised rules and player aid cards<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Upgrade kit for the owners of the previous version includes the following:<br/><br/>     Mounted Map with revised graphics<br/>     New card deck<br/>     Updated Rules &amp; Charts<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>There are also the deluxe mounted map and deluxe euro-style countersheet upgrades.<br/><br/> 
TZAAR is a game about making choices. Both players have 30 pieces, divided in three types: 6 Tzaars, 9 Tzarras and 15 Totts. The 3 types of pieces form a trinity: They cannot exist without each other. The aim is either to make the opponent run out of one of the three types of pieces or to put him in a position in which he cannot capture anymore. The tricky question the players will have to ask themselves on each of their turns is: &ldquo;Shall I make myself stronger or my opponent weaker?&rdquo; Meaning: Will you capture an opponent&rsquo;s piece and make him weaker, or will you jump on top of one of your own pieces and make yourself stronger? If you choose to jump on top of your own pieces too often, you will probably leave your opponent with too many pieces on the board. On the other hand, if you capture too often, you may end up with pieces that are not strong enough at the end of the game. What to do? Up to you to decide!<br/><br/>TZAAR is the most recent game in project GIPF, replacing TAMSK which was felt to not quite fit in with the others due to its use of sand timers.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     Boardspace.net (real time, against human or robot opponents)<br/>     Gamerz (turn-based, play by email or play by web)<br/>     Boîte_à_jeux (turn-based, play by web)<br/><br/><br/> Local Computer Play <br/><br/>     HTZAAR (made from Haskell, OpenGL, and SDL; can be compiled for Windows or Linux) (NOTE: this is no longer maintained)<br/>     <a target='_blank' href="http://www.ncc.up.pt/~pbv/stuff/hstzaar" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncc.up.pt/~pbv/stuff/hstzaar</a> HsTZAAR: improved version of HTZAAR with better AI and better graphical interface.

The board of this game consists of six rows. On each row, twelve gems (of several colors) are arranged. Each player places his pawn in front of one of those rows.<br/><br/>Each player receives a playing card on which a shape consisting of several squares is depicted. Each player also gets 12 tiles consisting of 2, 3, 4, or 5 squares in some shape. By means of a dice roll, each player is assigned three or four tiles that he has to use to fill the shape on his card.<br/><br/>The players try to solve their own &quot;puzzle.&quot; The race is timed by a sand glass. The outcome of this race determines the play on the main playing board.<br/><br/>The player who was the first to solve his puzzle in time gets to move his pawn up to three rows, the player who came second may move two rows, and the player in third may move a single row. The players may collect two gems from the front of the row their pawn is on, so the more rows you can move, the more control you have on what color gems you can collect.<br/><br/>After collecting gems, each player receives a new playing card with a new puzzle to solve, and a new round starts. In total, nine rounds are played.<br/><br/>In the end, the player who has collected the most gems in a single color wins the game.<br/><br/>Re-implemented as:<br/><br/>    Ubongo BMM<br/>    Ubongo extrem<br/>    Ubongo - Das Duell<br/>    Ubongo - 3D (2009)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> 
The goal is to have the fewest number of groups of tiles on the board at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The players take turns placing one of their five tiles on a 9x9 grid and then draw another tile to replace it.  There are three tiles which each player can place on each space: a letter, a number, or the item which represents the 3x3 sector of the board the space is in.<br/><br/>If another player has placed a tile it may be captured by playing a legal tile in its place, only if removing the tile doesn't break a group of tiles belonging to the player into more than one group. If players tie for the fewest number of groups at the end of the game, then the winner is the one who captured the fewest opponents' tiles.<br/><br/>Buy Microbadges<br/><br/>Uptown Fan<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     BrettspielWelt (real-time)<br/><br/><br/> 
Urban Myth consists of a game board divided into four city blocks, six playing pieces, and a deck of 700 game cards in six subject categories: Celebrity, Health, Classics, Nature, Business and Crime.<br/>Each Card lists either one or two urban legends printed on the front and a letter from the words M-Y-T-H or T-R-U-E on the back.  One out of every eight cards is a wild card bearing the Urban Myth logo, which can be substituted for any letter.<br/>The objective of Urban Myth is to be the first player to spell the word M-Y-T-H or the word T-R-U-E by collecting the letters on the back of the game cards.  Players earn letters by correctly identifying which stories are myth and which are true.<br/><br/> 
Recruit workers, buy projects, build ships. And use the ships to open new commercial routes to eastern Africa and India, to earn money and glory.<br/><br/>This is a resource management game, with an element of risk management, that works like this:<br/><br/>Beginning with the start player, each player takes one numbered disc and places it on top of his own coloured disc in one of the four action areas of the board. A Vasco da Gama tile states a number; everything above this number is free of charge, anything below will have to be paid for, so players will take this into account when taking numbered discs. When all players have placed four discs, a modifier to this 'activation number' is shown, and discs are worked by number. In the crew area players may hire crew and a captain, but this costs money. Each round there is a window of ships. The number on the left is the navigation strength, the number on the right is the required amount of different crew. Players choose a ship, pay for the crew and turn the tile to its other side - with a captain on top. In the navigation area, a player takes his ship and places it in a row of his choice, but he has to take care not to exceed the navigation strength of the ship.<br/><br/>The game lasts five rounds, after which the player with the most points has won.<br/><br/> 
The Walking Dead: The Board Game from Z-Man Games transforms the Robert Kirkman comic book series into a board game, giving &quot;fans the opportunity to play Rick, Shane, Andrea, and other favorite The Walking Dead characters as they deal with zombies, collect supplies and pick up the pieces of their lives&quot;, according to a press release announcing the game.

Fun is in the Balance!<br/>In a race against time, players attempt to &quot;one up&quot; each other by pulling Kiwi Disks from a teetering wall, and daring to stack them ever higher.

Wasabi! is a light and fast game where you compete against other players to assemble your quota of unique sushi recipes in a rapidly dwindling space.  Players draw a variety of delicious ingredients into their hand from the pantry and play them one at a time onto the board, building off of each other's previously-placed ingredients in the attempt to complete recipes of varying difficulty.<br/><br/>Completing a recipe earns you your choice of special actions from the kitchen to perform later (Chop!, Stack!, Switch!, Spicy!, and the dreaded Wasabi!) that will help you in your efforts or disrupt your opponents' carefully arranged creations-in-progress.<br/><br/>Completing a recipe with style will earn you bonus points, but you might not always have the time to set up such stylish maneuvers... balancing speed with technique will be crucial if you plan to win the game!<br/><br/>Victory comes as soon as the board fills up with ingredients.  Points for completed recipes plus bonuses are tabulated, and the winner is the player with the most points.  An extremely skilled player might score an instant victory by completing their quota of recipes before the board fills up.<br/><br/>

In Who Would Win? two players each draw one character card, then turn up an event card. Each player then has 20 seconds to argue why his character would win whatever event is presented. Why would Albert Einstein beat Darth Vader in a gardening contest? Why would Donald Trump prove to be a better figure skater than William Shakespeare? You tell me!<br/><br/>The other players serve as the jury and vote on which player had the better argument; that player receives the event card. The first player to win five event cards wins the game.<br/><br/> 
Wings of War is a game series which merges card and board game mechanics to recreate aerial combat. The first series of Wings of War games focus on the &quot;knights of the air&quot; age, World War I, portraying the abilities of the fighting planes of this period.<br/><br/>Airplanes are represented by a single card which is used as a playing piece on any open surface; the players choose and play simultaneously movement cards  to decide the actions of the airplane they control. Different planes use different decks of movement cards to represent their different maneuver capabilities, and different deck of &quot;Fire&quot; card are used to take into account their fighting effectiveness and to keep track of damage.<br/><br/>Each Wings of War set is a complete game for 2 to 4 players which may be combined with additional sets, or with other copies of the same set, to play larger games. For that purpose, 23 planes with different colors are included in each box. Each one is depicted after accurate historical documentation.<br/><br/>Wings of War - Famous aces is the first set of the WWI collection.

<br/><br/><br/>    <br/>         Gambit 7 has been separated from Wits &amp; Wagers based on game rule differences and at the request of the designer and publisher. <br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Trivia for People Who Don't Know Stuff! <br/>Not a trivia buff? It doesn&rsquo;t matter! Each player writes a guess to a question such as &ldquo;In what year did the bikini swimsuit makes its first appearance?&rdquo; or &ldquo;How many feet wide is an NFL football field?&rdquo; and places it face-up on the betting mat. Think you know the answer? Bet on your guess. Think you know who the experts are? Bet on their guess. The closest answer pays out according to the odds on the betting mat.  Strike it big and you&rsquo;ll be cheering like you just hit the jackpot!<br/><br/>Wits &amp; Wagers is a trivia game that lets you bet on anyone&rsquo;s answer. So you can win by making educated guesses, by playing the odds, or by knowing the interests of your friends. It can be taught in 2 minutes, played in 25 minutes, and accommodates up to 20 people in teams.<br/><br/>Wits &amp; Wagers Game Show events are hosted by North Star Games at Origins and GenCon.  These team events have gotten great buzz from Alan Moon, Tom Vasel, and hundreds of others.<br/><br/> 
Shades of Oh Hell!. With a 60 card deck comprising a standard deck plus 4 Wizards (high) and 4 Jesters (low). In the first hand 1 card is dealt to each player. In the second 2 and so on. The game is over after the hand in which all cards are dealt.<br/><br/>Trumps are determined by randomly showing a card from the rest of undealt pack, if the card is a Jester, NoTrump is played in the current round. If it is a wizard, the last player to bid gets to choose the trump, or choose to play NoTrump.<br/><br/>After examining your cards you state the number of tricks you will win. Each round each player puts down one card. The first Wizard played wins the trick, followed by the highest trump card, followed by the highest card in the suit of the first card played.<br/><br/>You get 20 points for correctly predicting how many tricks you will win, plus 10 points for each trick won. You lose 10 points for each trick over or under the amount you predicted.<br/><br/>The game has plenty of luck inherent into it, especially at first (the first few rounds). Later rounds have very little luck, and because scoring increases over time (more cards are being dealt, so bids are higher), the overall game is a very skillful game.<br/><br/>Good memory, counting, and knowledge of statistics are helpful in this game. <br/>[However, &quot;Wizard is pure fun, challenging, baffling and simply habit forming. Wizard is quickly becoming the most popular card game of the decade,&quot; according to the undated box. So presumably everyone can enjoy it, skilled or not.]<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     BrettspielWelt (real-time)<br/><br/><br/> 
In Word on the Street, players - either individually or in teams &ndash; try to claim letter tiles from the game board.<br/><br/>To set up the game, seventeen letter tiles (all the consonants in English other than j, q, x, and z) are placed in a strip down the center of the game board &ndash; the median strip of the street, if you will, which has two &quot;traffic lanes&quot; on either side of it. On a turn, one team is presented with a category such as &quot;types of fruit&quot; or &quot;something a player is wearing&quot;, and that team has thirty seconds to come up with an answer in that category, then move the letters in that word toward their side of the game board. Any letters in the word that are not on the game board are skipped. If the answer were &quot;pineapple&quot;, for example, the team would move P, N, P, P and L.<br/><br/>If a team moves a letter off the game board, it has claimed that letter and that tile will not move for the remainder of the game. The first team to claim eight letter tiles wins!<br/><br/> 
Word on the Street Junior uses the same game play as 2009&rsquo;s Word on the Street: Players are presented with a category, choose a word that fits that category, then move the letters in that word toward their side of the street. If a player or team moves eight letters off their side of the board, they win the game. Word on the Street Junior differs from its parent in that it includes categories appropriate for younger players (ages 8 and up instead of 12 and up) and the complete alphabet instead of only 17 letters. Including the vowels will likely make the game easier for younger players as they won&rsquo;t have to strain to think of words with little used consonants.<br/><br/> 
Yahtzee is a classic dice game played with 5 dice.  Each player's turn consists of rolling the dice up to 3 times in hope of making 1 of 13 categories.  Examples of categories are 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, straight, full house, etc.  Each player tries to fill in a score for each category, but this is not always possible.  When all players have entered a score or a zero for all 13 categories, the game ends and total scores are compared.<br/><br/>The traditional (public domain) game Yacht predates the trademarked game, and has slightly different scoring.<br/><br/>There are four basic scoring difference between the tradition game Yacht and Yahtzee.  They are:  1) Yacht has no Three of a Kind category, 2) there are no bonuses in Yacht, 3) there are no Joker rules in Yacht, and 4) the Full House category is scored as the sum of the dice.  The other scoring rules are identical between the two games.<br/><br/> 
The players each start with 5 rings on the board. Every time a ring is moved, it leaves a marker behind. Markers are white on one side and black on the other. When markers are jumped over by a ring they must be flipped, so their color is constantly changing. The players must try to form a row of 5 markers with their own color face up. If a player succeeds in doing so, he removes one of his rings as an indication that he has formed such a row. The first player to remove 3 of his rings wins the game. In other words, each row you make brings you closer to victory-but also makes you weaker, because you have one fewer ring to play with. Very tricky!<br/><br/>This game is part of project GIPF.<br/><br/> 
In this third addition to the GIPF Project players compete to acquire sets of multi-colored balls.  This is mostly accomplished by jumping one ball over one or more others, Checkers-style, on a hex board.  A player's turn consists of either jumping (which can be forced) or placing any color ball on the board and removing an empty space from the edge of the board.  In this manner, the play space continually shrinks, giving the endgame an almost claustrophobic feel.<br/><br/>This game is part of project GIPF.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href="http://www.gipf.com/zertz/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gipf.com/zertz/index.html</a><br/><br/> 
From the makers of Bananagrams, Zip-It is a two-player word game using dice. In a round, the players each take at random half of the 24 dice, then simultaneously assemble their dice into a crossword-style grid using any side of each die that they have. The first to do so says &quot;zip!&quot; and, if his words are valid, he scores a point on the self-scoring zippered pouch. The first player to reach ten points wins.<br/><br/> 
Zombie Fluxx is the zombie uprising card game with ever-changing rules.  Like Fluxx, players start off with the basic rules: draw 1, play 1.  After that, everything changes!  There are now six types of cards:<br/><br/><br/>     Keeper cards (possessions)<br/>     New Rule cards (changes gameplay rules)<br/>     Action cards (one-time actions)<br/>     Goal cards (victory conditions)<br/>     Creeper cards (undesirable Keepers)<br/>     Ungoal cards (conditions in which everybody loses!)<br/><br/><br/>Meet the goal to win the game.  A constantly-changing and challenging, but light and ultimately fun game.<br/><br/>Part of the Fluxx series.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Zombie Fluxx Flame-Thrower Expansion Pack<br/>    Fluxx Promo Cards<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

Each player uses small, large, wild, and exotic animals and their young to try to attract as many visitors as possible to their zoo. But be careful - the zoo must be carefully planned. Before you know it, you have too many animals and no more room for them. That brings minus points! Luckily, your zoo can expand. A zoo of a family game in which less is sometimes more...<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>     Coloretto by Michael Schacht<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Digital Versions:<br/><br/>     <a target='_blank' href="http://videogamegeek.com/videogame/86063/zooloretto" rel="nofollow">http://videogamegeek.com/videogame/86063/zooloretto</a> CD/DVD for Windows<br/>     SpinBottle Games (8/5/09) for iPhone/iPod Touch<br/>     as &quot;Animal Tycoon&quot; (Nov/09) for Mobile<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Boxed Versions:<br/><br/>     Burgers' Zoo <br/>     Zooloretto Mini (diff. rules) <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Boxed Expansions:<br/><br/>     Zooloretto XXL<br/>     Zooloretto Exotic<br/>     Zooloretto Boss<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Small Expansions:<br/><br/>     Rio Grande Games Exp.
